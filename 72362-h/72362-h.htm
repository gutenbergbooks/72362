<p><br></p>

<p>IT was early June in the year eighteen hundred and fifteen, and the
warm sun shone down upon the little farmhouse of Monsieur le Grand
and touched the old red brick walls lovingly. The bees hummed in the
garden, and there was no other sound except the lowing of the cattle
and the occasional merry noise of children's laughter.</p>

<p>It all seemed very peaceful and quiet, and yet a short distance away
two great armies were preparing for the great battle which was shortly
afterwards fought upon the field of Waterloo.</p>

<p>It seemed strange that the little farmhouse had escaped observation,
for most of the farms and cottages round had soldiers quartered in
them, but le Grand's house was tucked away in the hollow of a hill and
was far off the beaten track, about fifteen miles from the town of
Nivelle.</p>

<p>Little Jean le Grand came trudging up the garden path, sighing, as
he wiped his hot brow with the back of his sunburnt hand, for he was
very weary. The work of the farm was too much for such a lad, but the
good mother, who usually did her share, was ailing, and as for the
father—well, he was away, no doubt drinking and making merry with the
soldiers quartered in the next village, for Monsieur le Grand was
somewhat of a ne'er-do-well and could never be made to work whilst
others would work for him.</p>

<p>As Jean entered the house-place, he saw his mother stooping over the
hearth, stirring a pot, the odours from which made Jean realise how
very hungry he was.</p>

<p>"Supper is quite ready, dear one," said his mother. "I will call those
rascals in."</p>

<p>But the two young children had had apparently scented supper from afar
and came racing in to take their share.</p>

<p>In a very short space of time the food was all eaten, and the pot and
plates cleared away; the two younger children crept away to bed, and
Jean and his mother sat by the ingle nook to discuss the farm work, and
the best remedy for a sick cow.</p>

<p>"I wish the father were home," sighed the mother. "Celeste needs
watching to-night, and you are far too weary, and I fear I should but
increase my rheumatism."</p>

<p>At that moment the door opened and Monsieur le Grand came in—"Jean, my
lad," he cried jovially, "saddle the grey the grey mare and take a sup
of the mother's cordial to hearten you, for you have a long ride before
you; but there will be an ample reward to pay you for your trouble. It
has come my ears, no matter how, that the English General is at St.
Etienne with but a small escort, and the soldiers down at the village
tell me that Napoleon would give a fortune for the news—well, what
matters it to us who wins, English or French, we are safe enough away
here, and I mean to earn the French gold; but away with you, for, if
I mistake not, old Jacques Casson is off already to try his luck, but
I'll back you to reach Limal before he is two leagues on the way."</p>

<p><br></p>

<figure class="figcenter" id="image006" style="max-width: 25.8125em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/image006.jpg" alt="image006">
</figure>

<p><br></p>

<p>Jean and his mother looked at each other in horror—le Grand had
committed many foolish acts, but never had they dreamt he would turn
traitor and betray his country.</p>

<p>The mother went out and beckoned Jean to follow her.</p>

<p>"You must indeed ride far and fast to-night, Jean," she said—"it is
useless to argue with your father, the soldiers have given him too much
wine, or he would never have done this thing. Ride as fast as the grey
mare will carry you to St. Etienne and warn the English General his
whereabouts are known. You must not let them be taken in a trap, and
Jacques Casson must be well on his way by now."</p>

<p>She kissed her boy and in five minutes' time the echo of the grey
mare's hoofs was dying away in the distance.</p>

<p>Jean never forgot that ride. On, on, on, mile after mile, past sleeping
villages, past meadows and rivers, fearing a foe in every shadow that
fell across the white moonlit road, for oh! if he fell into the hands
of the French, he would never be able to save the English General and
his father would be disgraced for ever.</p>

<p>By the time the grey mare's speed began to slacken Jean was sobbing
frantically—would he ever reach St. Etienne in time?</p>

<p>"Halt! Who goes there?" the dreadful challenge rang out at length.</p>

<p>Jean pounded his heels into the grey mare's flanks, she made a gallant
bound forward, but to no purpose: a hand seized the bridle and dragged
her back upon her haunches, and Jean was hauled roughly from his seat,
and hurried into a hut near by, where a number of French officers were
sleeping by the fire. They were soon roused and bade Jean give an
account of himself.</p>

<p>Desperate with fear Jean lied as he had never lied before and never
would again.</p>

<p>"I come from Villeton," he said, "and am riding to Bousval—the English
General is at Villeton with but a small escort and my father sends
me to the French Captain Goulet with the news—he is in Monsieur le
Capitaine's pay."</p>

<p>Jean had scarcely finished speaking when the order to mount was given,
the commanding officer being so anxious to steal a march on Captain
Goulet and secure the General himself, that he did not even remember
to take Jean with him as a security for his good faith, and as soon as
they were away Jean mounted his tired mare and in an hour's time was
riding into St. Etienne. Here he told his story to the first English
soldier who could understand him, and then, having done his duty, he
fainted away from sheer exhaustion.</p>

<p><br></p>

<figure class="figcenter" id="image007" style="max-width: 25.8125em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/image007.jpg" alt="image007">
</figure>

<p><br></p>

<p>When he came to himself again he found he was in the midst of a group
of English soldiers, who began to question him eagerly, but he shook
his head, he could not understand them. Very soon an interpreter was
found, and on Jean eagerly enquiring if the General were safe the young
office laughed and told him he had never been near the town—"But don't
look so downfallen," he said kindly, "you have saved my life, I do not
doubt; I have no mind to be caught in a French trap, and we are off
now to join the General, and you, my lad, had best come with us, for I
fancy you would have too warm a reception if you fell into the hands of
those same hussars you sent upon a wildgoose chase."</p>

<p>And so it fell out that Jean rode away with his new friends and shortly
afterwards became attached to the English army as a drummer boy.</p>

<p>He did not go home until long after the war was ended, and then only
on a short leave, but what was his amazement to find his father a
completely altered man. Being firmly convinced that he had sent his son
to his death, for the one letter Jean had managed to send had never
reached the farm, poor le Grand never ceased to blame himself. He gave
up drinking too much wine and took to tilling the ground and looking
after his farm, and when the terrible remorse he had suffered from was
removed, he found he did not care to revert to his former habits.</p>

<p>As for Jean, having served his time in the English army and covered
himself with honour and glory, he returned one day to the old farmhouse
in the little Belgian village and lived there in ease and plenty for
the rest of his days.</p>

<em><b><a id="Story_2">Defending the Fort</a></b></em>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>A SOLDIER in the uniform of a French grenadier was clambering up the
side of a steep ravine. His face and hands were covered with scratches,
and he was hot and breathless, but still he pressed eagerly after his
guide, a young goatherd, only pausing for a second to ask, "Does the
fort lie over yonder?"</p>

<p>"But half a league further," answered the boy, tossing back his shaggy
hair, and on they plunged through the underwood, by a path that nobody
but one born and bred among those mountains could have found.</p>

<p>They had come six miles across country at a desperate pace, but fatigue
was nothing to the grenadier, La Tour d'Auvergne, a name already known
for valour throughout the length and breadth of France. He had a
mission to accomplish, and his duty came before all else.</p>

<p>"Yonder is the fort; you have but to follow the path up the pass," said
his guide at last.</p>

<p>La Tour's eyes brightened, he put some money into the lad's hand, and
the latter disappeared among the bushes. Inspired by fresh courage the
weary grenadier pounded up the narrow rocky way, but he was surprised,
as he approached the building, that no sentinel challenged him. What
was the garrison doing that it took no precautions against a sudden
attack? La Tour had an inward feeling that all was not right: his heart
misgave him as he rushed up to the door.</p>

<p><br></p>

<figure class="figcenter" id="image009" style="max-width: 25.8125em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/image009.jpg" alt="image009">
</figure>

<p><br></p>

<p>Why he had come was that he had received news that a regiment of
Austrians was pushing forward to get possession of the fort. If they
succeeded, it would be a serious matter for the French army, and La
Tour had set out instantly to warn the garrison. The fort was ten miles
distant by road, but he had found a young goatherd to take him a short
way across the mountains.</p>

<p>The door yielded as the grenadier flung his weight against it: he
gave a shout as he burst into the court, but no one answered it. "The
cowards!" he exclaimed in indignation, "they have deserted the place!
The mean-spirited rascals! Would that I had the hanging of them!"</p>

<p>It was but too true: the garrison had evidently been warned of the
approach of the enemy, and had fled after the main body of the
French army. They had gone off in a great hurry, for muskets lay
scattered about on the ground. "Villains!" muttered La Tour, and,
having completed his survey of the place, he began to prepare for
the Austrians. The dauntless soldier knew that if he could delay the
enemy's movements for even twenty-four hours, it would be of enormous
value to his countrymen. The fort was in a fine position, at the head
of a steep pass, and La Tour meant to hold it as long as there was life
in his lean, strong body.</p>

<p>There were some thirty muskets, and these he loaded; he then barricaded
the heavy door as well as he could, ate a hearty meal—plenty of
provisions were left fortunately—and sat down to await the enemy.</p>

<p>The night came on, and presently the grenadier caught the sound of
footsteps tramping up the narrow pass. Instantly he fired a couple of
shots into the darkness and heard the footsteps retreating. Although
desperately weary, the defender of the fort did not dare to close his
eyes, and he was glad enough when morning dawned.</p>

<p>"We shall see what will happen now," said La Tour to himself.</p>

<p>As soon as it was light, a soldier with a flag of truce came up the
path: the Austrian Government had sent to summon the garrison to
surrender.</p>

<p>La Tour naturally did not let the messenger inside. "You can go back
and inform your Commandant," he called out, "that we are here to defend
the pass for France, and that as long as there is a man left, this fort
will not yield."</p>

<p><br></p>

<figure class="figcenter" id="image010" style="max-width: 25.8125em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/image010.jpg" alt="image010">
</figure>

<p><br></p>

<p>The envoy retired, and the bold grenadier made ready for action.
Presently he found that the Austrians were hauling a small cannon up
the pass, and as soon as the gunners came in sight he let fly at them,
taking care to keep well under cover himself. Five men went down, one
after the other, and the rest beat a retreat.</p>

<p>"Ah, ha! 'tis not as easy as you fancied, my fine fellows," said La
Tour, re-loading his guns.</p>

<p>He guessed pretty well that the enemy's next move would be to make a
sudden dash and try and take the fort by storm, and he guessed rightly.
But the pass was so narrow that the men could only come on two abreast,
and La Tour, an expert at quick firing, picked them off until fifteen
were lying dead or wounded on the ground. Scared, the rest fled down
the pass once more, leaving the "garrison" a victor. The Commandant was
furious, and later a third assault was made, but with the same result
as before. By sunset more than forty of his men were killed. The rest
were getting discouraged too: for it was like walking into the jaws of
certain death to march up that narrow path.</p>

<p>Once again the white flag was seen before the main entrance of the
fort, and the garrison was called upon to surrender. By this time La
Tour was almost worn out: he knew that he could not possibly hold out
much longer, so he proceeded to make the best terms he could.</p>

<p>"The garrison is to be allowed to march out with their arms, and retire
unmolested to the French army," was his stipulation.</p>

<p>After a good deal of parleying, the Commandant agreed to this, and La
Tour promised to give up the fort at break of day. Then he dropped
down, half dead with fatigue, and went to sleep; he had done all he
could, and had gained a certain amount of time. Probably if the real
garrison had been there, they might not have been able to accomplish
much more.</p>

<p>The grenadier was so weary that the sun was already high when he woke,
and a furious battering at the great door reminded him of his compact.
The Austrians were outside clamouring for the fort to be delivered up
to them.</p>

<p>"You are in too great a hurry, my friends," muttered La Tour,
grabbing an armful of muskets, "come, a little patience"—as the blows
re-doubled—"the garrison is not ready yet," and he went on calmly
gathering the guns together. Then he picked up a couple of straps and
fastened them together.</p>

<p><br></p>

<figure class="figcenter" id="image011" style="max-width: 25.8125em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/image011.jpg" alt="image011">
</figure>

<p><br></p>

<p>Outside, on the little plateau at the head of the pass which the
Austrians had vainly attempted to gain, the troops were now drawn up in
line. They left a space for the garrison to march through, and waited
impatiently for them to appear.</p>

<p>"What on earth are the fellows about?" growled the Colonel, who was in
command, "do they mean to keep us here all day? Here, go and tell the
Captain that if the fort be not instantly given into my hands, I shall
hold the agreement at an end."</p>

<p>At that moment the heavy door was pushed slowly open, and, to the
astonishment of the Austrians, a solitary man appeared, a grenadier. He
staggered along with thirty muskets strapped on his back, and, as the
Colonel stepped forward, La Tour d'Auvergne saluted.</p>

<p>"But where is the garrison?" cried the Colonel quickly.</p>

<p>"It means that you behold here the garrison, Colonel."</p>

<p>"What!" thundered the Austrian, "do you expect me to believe that
we have been held at bay all these hours by one man? Where are your
comrades?"</p>

<p>La Tour explained, and, for a moment, the officer stood dumb-founded:
then he raised his hand to his cap, saying, "Grenadier, you are a hero!
Your emperor is indeed fortunate to possess so valiant a soldier," and
a ringing shout of approval went up from the troops as La Tour, again
saluting, went slowly onwards, with his load of weapons. He had killed
a number of their companions, but they knew how to respect a brave
soldier.</p>

<p>La Tour was one of the most modest of men, and would never accept the
honours and dignities offered him as a reward for his many deeds of
valour. One title, however, was given to him, by which he was known
both in his own country and in others, that of "The First Grenadier of
France."</p>

<p>So one reads of him in the pages of history, and at Carhaix, in
Brittany, his birthplace, a memorial ceremony was kept up for about
fifteen years after his death in 1800.</p>

<p>The roll-call of the Grenadiers began each day with the famous name
of La Tour d'Auvergne. There was an impressive silence that lasted a
few moments, and then the colour sergeant, stepping forward, saluted
gravely, and made answer: "Dead on the field of honour!"</p>

<em><b><a id="Story_3">A Border Raid</a></b></em>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>LONG John o' the Limp sat with his back against the mounting-block,
polishing a pair of steel gauntlets.</p>

<p>The sun, not a great way as yet above the low peat hills that edged the
little valley to eastwards, flung the shadow of the grey peel-tower far
along the grass, and Long John o' the Limp shifted his legs to bring
them into the sunshine.</p>

<p>"Hey! but I must be growing old, for I get as fond of warmth nowadays
as a cat of the fire," grunted the moss-trooper, his keen eye following
the course of the stream that gurgled among its rushes as it flowed
from the Scottish border, "and yet—if those reiving loons came riding
here I doubt not they would find some bite still left in these withered
jaws!"</p>

<p>"Good-morrow, Long John," said a sweet girl voice behind him, and there
in the doorway of the Tower stood little Mistress Alison Langley, hawk
upon fist, and her riding skirt gathered up in the other hand.</p>

<p>"Grammercy, child, and where be ye going?" said the moss-trooper,
getting slowly to his feet, for he was sadly lame from the slash of a
Jedburgh axe in an old border raid.</p>

<p>"Jocelyn flies his new falcon on the Red Moss, and I go with him," said
the pretty little maid, her golden hair all a-curl about her cheeks,
and looking mighty charming in the ancient doorway.</p>

<p>Before Long John could open his mouth, Jocelyn came down the narrow
stone stairs which wound in the thickness of the wall, and burst out
into the sunshine—a brown-faced boy in a green doublet, a heron's
feather in his flat cap, and a pair of silver spurs on his heels.</p>

<p>"Have a care, Master Jocelyn," said Long John, "the Red Moss is not the
safest place for your father's son, and if Wat Armstrong should spy
you, there will be wiping off of old scores."</p>

<p>"Black Wat has not dared to show his nose on English ground since my
father burned his tower and harried his lands three years ago," said
Jocelyn proudly; "and why should he be on the Red Moss to-day?"</p>

<p>"Laddie," said the old man, smiling, the while he shook his grey head,
"the Langleys were ever venturesome; but go your own road, only, mind
ye, the Flower o' Langley goes wi' ye, and if she come to harm whilst
your father is away I would not face his wrath for all the gold in
Northumberland!"</p>

<p>"My sister will never meet hurt or harm while I am beside her," cried
Jocelyn, touching his sword significantly; "but I promise you we will
ride no farther than the White Stone, and here comes Halbert with the
horses."</p>

<p>Through the ford, and up the valley they went, scaring the feeding
cattle, scattering the snowy tufts of the cotton grass, over the
springy heather that purpled the hillside, and so to the moss, three
miles away.</p>

<p>There, with eyes dancing and cheeks aglow, they reined in beside
a clump of gean, or wild cherry, and scanned the sedgy marsh that
bordered the lonely moorland.</p>

<p>"Yonder is our quarry, Ally—see, a grey heron rising from the reeds!"
and the boy unhooded the gerfalcon in haste. "Hooha—ha—ha!" he cried,
tossing the bird free, and away it raked, with the musical jingle of
bells, and graceful trail of jesses.</p>

<p>The heron changed its seemingly slow flight and mounted rapidly, up,
up; but the falcon, winging in circles, rose high above the quarry, and
poised for the stoop with quiver of sails and train wide spread. Then,
dropping with the rapidity of light, set his pounces into the heron.</p>

<p>With a mighty whir of wings, and showering of feathers, the two birds
came to earth, and Jocelyn gave a loud "whoop," which, in the language
of falconry, meant a kill.</p>

<p>"Come along, Ally," he shouted, setting his pony over the trickle of a
tiny burn, "you shall have a fine bunch of tail coverts." But the words
had scarce left Jocelyn's lips when Alison saw him pull the grey jennet
well nigh on to his croup and toss his arm up for a danger signal.</p>

<p>There were armed men upon the moss and the glint of the sun upon steel
caps.</p>

<p><br></p>

<p><br></p>

<p>Alison had already leaped her pony across the burn, where the
treacherous quagmire was soft and spongy, and she gave a cry of alarm
as the frightened creature sank over his fetlocks and floundered wildly.</p>

<p>"Have no fear, little lady," said a deep voice beside her, and a
strange man rose out of the hazel copse and grasped her rein.</p>

<p>A plunge and a squeal of terror from the pony, and then the stranger
had plucked the pair from all danger, and set them safely in the bed of
the burn.</p>

<p>"By my faith, pretty lassie, ye hae a fine spirit and a soft cheek,"
said the bearded man, patting the one as he praised the other; "but
your confounded moss is a fearsome spot, and I came none too soon—nay,
look not sae scared—Wat Armstrong will do ye nae hurt, and maybe ye'll
tell me if we ride in the way for Langley Tower?"</p>

<p>Jocelyn came spurring back.</p>

<p>"If you follow us we will show you the path you seek," he said, his
face scarlet, and his eyes meeting Alison's. "You have saved my sister
from peril, and one courtesy deserves another," and thus speaking, he
led her pony up to the bank top, as the reiver's band came straggling
out of the hazel copse, forty moss-troopers with spears and axes.</p>

<p>"Now for our lives, Ally," he cried, striking her pony with the flat of
his sword, and away tore brother and sister up the grassy valley before
the reiver had inkling of their design.</p>

<p>"By the rood!" shouted Black Wat, smiting his thigh, "they hae baith
of them the fair hair of the cursed Langleys—ride men, ride, else our
trouble is a' for naught—we shall cut them off at the brae heid!"</p>

<p>From forty throats went up a yell that sent the curlews wheeling over
the moss, and the earth trembled with the thunder of iron hoofs, but
the ponies were fresh, and pacing like the wind, and already they had
good start of their pursuers.</p>

<p>"Beware the heather roots, Ally," cried Jocelyn between his set teeth,
"one stumble, and they will burn our Tower; if aught happen me, ride on
and warn Long John!"</p>

<p>She nodded, and no other word was spoken, as they tore side by side
past the rowan trees that showed their red berries, and the clumps of
silver birch.</p>

<p>       *       *       *       *       *</p>

<p>"Hey, but the times are soft as tow on a distaff," said Long John o'
the Limp, out upon the parapet that girdled the top of the peel; "I
have seen the day when three bands have been in sight i' the same
morning coming to our undoing, and the burn running red before noon;
ay, and I mind me when Surrey marched up to fight the Scots, wi'
glaives and spears bristling like reeds in a mere; but now, men have
other ways, and look where these old eyes may—"</p>

<p>The old eyes roving round the horizon of Pet Hill and Autumn Wood
suddenly dilated, and Long John o' the Limp grasped the parapet with a
giant's grip.</p>

<p>"Horsemen, and riding on the spur!" he cried, "and hey, what is
this?—the children flying through the stream—bravely ridden, Flower
o' Langley—ho, there! Jock, Halbert, Tam Foster, all o' ye—a raid, a
raid—drive in the kye and stir yersels, the reiving loons are upon us!"</p>

<p><br></p>

<p><br></p>

<p>Long John descended the stairs at infinite risk of his neck, and
reached the ground floor as Jocelyn rode in at the doorway and sprang
out of the saddle.</p>

<p>"Armstrong and a couple of score at his back," panted Jocelyn,
and, outside at a bound, he stayed Alison, who was on the point of
dismounting.</p>

<p>"Nay, Ally," he cried, "you must rouse the countryside and send us
help; away up the loan, and you'll be over the brae top before they see
you—warn them at the Long House, and they will fire Lattfell beacon,
then on to the Charltons and bid them send to the Musgraves—go, go, I
hear their gallop now!"</p>

<p>"Ay, go, lassie," said the old moss-trooper, "we'll need all the help
we may; let the sick cow bide, Jock, they're welcome to her; and now,
within boys, we've saved all we can, and yonder comes Black Wat hissel."</p>

<p>Jocelyn watched the whisk of the blue riding skirt disappear beyond the
orchard trees, and ran into the Tower, the iron grille swinging to with
a clang as Halbert secured it.</p>

<p>Five minutes before all had been peace, and the sun shining on the
green of the grass; now, they stood in the peculiar coolness of the
stone walls, watching the ragged reivers splash through the ford, and
pull up in a bunch in front of the doorway.</p>

<p>The Tower, strongly built of grey stone, was dimly lit by arrow slits,
and in the lower story the frightened cattle lowed.</p>

<p>About it clustered the outbuildings, byres and stabling; but on
occasions like the present, all the livestock were driven within, and
grille and door stoutly barred.</p>

<p>The door stood half open now, as Black Wat Armstrong reined in before
the square entrance, laughing aloud.</p>

<p>He was clad in breast and back piece, and had riding boots reaching
above his knee, and in addition to the long sword at his hip, he
carried a Jedburgh axe hanging by a thong from his saddle.</p>

<p>"Come forth, Ned Langley," he said, in a great voice, "Wat Armstrong of
Bannockbrae has somewhat to say to ye!"</p>

<p>"Get ye gone, Black Wat," replied Long John, derisively, from the
interior; "Captain Langley is away, and we like not Scots thieves
around the peel, being very particular of our acquaintance."</p>

<p>"Say ye so, Long John o' the Limp, for I ken your croak weel; ye shall
not be ower burdened wi' my company, man, for we'll e'en hang ye in ten
minutes," and the borderer laughed at his own rough jest. "In with the
door, lads, and the loons shall hae shorter shrift than they gied to
our ain puir folk!"</p>

<p>A dozen moss-troopers dismounted and ran towards the grille, and the
little garrison clanged the inner door to, but not before Halbert's
arbalist twanged, and a bolt flew into the midst of the attacking
party, stretching one of them lifeless, his steel cap ringing against
the horse-block as he fell.</p>

<p>"Up wi' ye, boys!" cried Long John, "we've plums for their pudding
in plenty above there, and they who come to meat at Langley peel,
unbidden, must bring lang spoons."</p>

<p>Jocelyn led the way, scampering like a rabbit up the steep, well-worn
stairs; and bursting out on to the parapet, his first thought was of
his sister.</p>

<p>Far away southward he saw a tiny moving object which vanished round the
shoulder of the hill, and he knew she was safe, and that help would not
be long in coming; then he crept to the parapet and looked over.</p>

<p>A shower of ringing blows from a heavy sledgehammer was falling upon
the grille.</p>

<p>"Lads," said Long John, crawling out upon the roof, with a grim smile,
"they knock over loud to our fancy, being unmannerly Scots, but they
shall taste a 'Langley loaf,'" and he picked up a great fragment of
rock that lay upon a pile that had evidently been brought there for
precisely such a purpose.</p>

<p>"Back!" shouted Armstrong, sitting on his horse, and spying five
figures appear on a sudden, each outlined against the blue sky above
him; but the warning came too late, and the huge stones fell among the
surge of men that sprang away from the door.</p>

<p>"That's Hal o' the Cleuch, wi' his neck broken," cried Long John,
looking down, "'twas he gave me the lick on the shinbone when we rode
back from Bannockbrae, and I'll now die happier for to-day's work!"</p>

<p>"I'll no take away from my father's joy, though 'twas my stone killed
him," whispered Halbert to Tam Foster. "Ha, the rogues have fired the
byre!"</p>

<p>A tremendous shout rose from the reivers, as a tongue of flame leaped
upwards from the outlying buildings; and the soft wind wreathed the
peel itself in smoke.</p>

<p>"We'll no want for a beacon now to raise the countryside, Wat
Armstrong!" called Long John o' the Limp. "If ye've a mind to come in,
take an old man's advice and delay not; we're five here and you two
score—fie on ye! Wat, we'd hae brent your rat hole sooner than this!"</p>

<p>Black Wat's eyes sparkled savagely.</p>

<p>"Sim Salkeld," said he, to a red-haired reiver, "yonder window will
serve us while the smoke hides it; set a ladder cautiously and I'll up
and in."</p>

<p>The window lit the living room in the second story, and was good
five-and-twenty feet from the ground: under cover of the burning byre
they lashed two ladders together, and followed their leader, while the
rest engaged the attention of the little garrison by a bold attack on
the main door.</p>

<p>A powerful, bearded man was Wat Armstrong, and his grasp was on the
iron bars of the window when a shrill cry made him look upward.</p>

<p>"Help! Long John," screamed Jocelyn, peering over the parapet as the
wind suddenly curled the smoke away and revealed the danger, and Black
Wat closed his eyes involuntarily as a jagged rock came hurtling
through the air.</p>

<p>It struck the second reiver standing on the rungs below him, and with a
terrible yell the man fell backwards, dragging the ladder away to fall
crashing into the blaze.</p>

<p>"Hold, boys," said Long John, checking the avalanche of missiles that
was about to descend on the wretched man clinging to the iron bars,
"this comes o' a man climbing above his station; how are ye feelin'
now, Black Wat Armstrong?"</p>

<p>The two enemies glared into each other's eyes, and the reiver's reply
was drowned in a cry of triumph from the Tower, and the clamour of
dismay that rose from the moss-troopers below.</p>

<p>A man clad in half armour, with a steel basinet on his head, must needs
pause before he drops twenty-five feet on to the hewn rock, but already
his men were racing to the ricks and returning with huge armfuls of hay
to break his fall.</p>

<p>"Father," cried Halbert, poising a slab of freestone that he had torn
from the roof, "he'll be away in a trice!"</p>

<p>"Fool, Halbert," said the old man, "cock your eye to the loan-head,
and tell me what you see!" and Long John o' the Limp sent a screech of
laughter into the clear air.</p>

<p><br></p>

<p><br></p>

<p>They looked, and saw, and the reivers saw it at the same moment; for,
galloping as hard as horse could go, came Captain Langley, with full
fifty stout men of Northumberland behind him, and, at his side, brave
little Alison on her sorrel pony.</p>

<p>A thunder of hoofs, a whoop, and a flashing of steel, and then a wild
ride round the smoking byre, and through the ford, and the invaders
fleeing with hotspur for the "Bateable Land," leaving their leader
still grasping the iron bars and glowering at the spear points beneath
him.</p>

<p>Captain Langley pulled up and laughed aloud. "Let fall your axe, Wat
Armstrong, and we'll let you down," he called. "I have a word to sav to
you; bring ladders here."</p>

<p>The baffled reiver descended slowly with his bloodshot eyes on his
captor's, expecting nothing less than death, but Langley motioned back
the spears, and rode forward a pace to meet his old enemy.</p>

<p>"You saved my lassie, Armstrong, and you spake her fair: go your ways,
man; you'll leave horses and harness enough to pay for yonder burnt
byre," said he.</p>

<p>The reiver looked hard at him, and there was silence for a moment.</p>

<p>"Ye brent my Tower o' Bannockbrae," he said, and then paused, as though
bewildered.</p>

<p>"Ye slew my brother before that," replied the Captain sternly, as
Alison drew beside him.</p>

<p>"Gie me your hand, Langley, for ye're a guid mon, an' a forgiving,"
said the grizzled raider, drawing off his gauntlet; "but ne'er shall it
be said that a Scot fell short o' an English borderer in generosity,
an' ye hae my word that Langley Peel gaes free o' Wat Armstrong
henceforward!"</p>

<p>The two strong men gripped hands, and a right blithe shout went up from
the onlookers.</p>

<p>"Take your horse, friend," said the captain, "'tis far to fare afoot,"
and when the reiver turned at the head of valley and waved his arm,
Long John o' the Limp on the Tower top led the ringing cheer that sped
him on his way; and the sun came out, and the grass grew green again,
and all was peace on the lonely border.</p>

<em><b><a id="Story_4">A Pair of Brave Maids</a></b></em>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>"GILES, my lady bids you drive more warily!"</p>

<p>Lady Saxilby's coachman turned a wrathful face, red with exertion,
towards the speaker, Phoebe. But the coach gave a lurch, and the
waiting-maid's head disappeared. The road was terrible, and Giles had
his work cut out for him. By his side sat my lard's new servant, Roger
Clobery; while inside the lumbering vehicle were Lady Saxilby, her two
daughters, and the maid, Phoebe. They were travelling down to Iver
Hall, the family country seat, and had already been five days on the
road.</p>

<p>Joan Saxilby was fourteen, her sister Letty a year younger, and both
were pretty, dark-haired lassies. Their father, Lord Saxilby, lay in
the Tower, accused of being concerned in a Jacobite plot, and the girls
were surprised at their mother leaving town at such a critical time. If
the accusation were proved it would certainly go ill with him. There
was a son, nineteen, but he had managed to disappear at the time when
Lord Saxilby and some others were arrested, and no news of Dick had
come for many a day.</p>

<p>The party were descending a hill within a few miles of Iver when Letty,
flung bodily on the top of Phoebe, shrieked, "Mother, we are over!"</p>

<p>It was no fault of Giles that the linch-pin should come out of one of
the wheels. He could do nothing, and the coach toppled heavily over on
its side, dragging down the struggling horses with it. Giles himself
was pitched into a bush; Clobery saved himself by an active spring, and
hurried to extricate the young ladies and the weeping Phoebe through
the window that was uppermost. When Lady Saxilby was got out it was
found that she had hurt her shoulder severely, and they were obliged to
carry her to the nearest shelter, a tumbledown farmhouse.</p>

<p>Giles went off on one of the horses to try and find a doctor, and Joan,
hovering round her mother in great concern, heard her murmur in a tone
of bitter distress:</p>

<p>"It may be too late now."</p>

<p>"Mother, dear, can I not do anything?" said Joan, earnestly.</p>

<p>Lady Saxilby looked at her hesitatingly.</p>

<p>"Joan, would you be afraid to go to Iver to-night by yourself?"</p>

<p>It would soon be dusk, but the girl, impressed, answered sturdily:</p>

<p>"No, mother; I will go."</p>

<p>"The pain gets worse," said Lady Saxilby, faintly; "put your ear close
to my lips, Joan. You—you must try to save your father; now, listen."</p>

<p>Joan listened, and her face grew grave and eager. She understood now
why someone in the secret ought to go to Iver as soon as possible.</p>

<p>"Burn every scrap," concluded her ladyship, and closed her eyes,
exhausted.</p>

<p><br></p>

<figure class="figcenter" id="image017" style="max-width: 25.8125em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/image017.jpg" alt="image017">
</figure>

<p><br></p>

<p>Phoebe came back at that instant. Joan beckoned Letty out into the
garden, and whispered to her for a few minutes. "I must go with you,"
said Letty, with decision. "Giles mayn't be back yet, and Clobery—" she
paused and looked at her sister.</p>

<p>"I don't like him either," said Joan. "Very well, Letty, we will go
together."</p>

<p>She felt that she had a good deal on her shoulders; her mother had been
too ill to give her any counsel. And she must not fail either, for
brave men's lives were at stake.</p>

<p>The reason of Lady Saxilby's hurried journey was this. She had received
from her husband, by the hand of Clobery, a scrap of paper with three
crosses marked on it. One cross signified, as she knew, "Destroy all
papers at Iver," two that it was urgent, three that his life depended
upon it. Lady Saxilby told Joan where the secret hiding-place was, and
particularly bade her burn a paper with a long list of names on it. It
was hard to leave their mother in her present state, but the girls knew
they must not linger; so without saying anything to Phoebe, who was a
chatterbox, they stole down the lane, hoping to find their way back to
the high road and reach Iver before nightfall.</p>

<p>It was a long and lonely tramp, for dusk came on, and they wandered
about a common for nearly an hour before they could discover a path.
Tired to begin with, they grew desperately weary, and hungry too into
the bargain. The tears came into the girls' eyes, but they struggled
on, cheering each other as best they could, and at last their courage
and perseverance were rewarded, and they crept up to the side entrance
of Iver Hall.</p>

<p>It was a huge, rambling old building, standing away by itself, and
many a Jacobite meeting had been held in secret beneath its roof. An
ancient servitor and his wife had been left in charge while the family
was away, and greatly astonished were they when Joan's voice begged for
admittance. Old Doggory unbarred the door, holding a light in one hand.
Before he could say a word Joan had snatched this light from him, and
was making for the staircase, Letty following her closely. The girls
had forgotten their fatigue, they only thought of their father's danger.</p>

<p>Yes, the papers were there. Joan, with trembling fingers, drew them
from the cunningly-contrived hiding-place. "Quick, Letty, the light,"
she murmured.</p>

<p>A step was heard behind them; Letty gave a startled cry, while Joan
felt her arm clutched. Looking up, she met the triumphant gaze of Roger
Clobery, and in a second he had snatched the bundle of papers from her.</p>

<p><br></p>

<figure class="figcenter" id="image018" style="max-width: 25.8125em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/image018.jpg" alt="image018">
</figure>

<p><br></p>

<p>"Nicely trapped," said the fellow, mockingly. "I have been waiting for
someone to show me the trick of that sliding panel. We guessed the
papers we wanted were down at this old owl's nest."</p>

<p>"You spy!" cried Joan, indignantly, turning very white.</p>

<p>"Call me what you will, young mistress," returned Clobery, grinning,
"it matters not. We have got what we have been waiting and working for,
and there will be a rare clearance of the rebels, I warrant you, when I
get back to town."</p>

<p>The hearts of the two girls died within them; they had failed, and at
the last minute too, which made it all the more bitter. Their father
would be executed, and who could tell how many more with him? The list
of names looked a lengthy one. Joan made one despairing effort. Drawing
herself up, and trying to look much older than she was, she said,
haughtily:</p>

<p>"Perhaps you need money. How much will you take to give me back those
papers?"</p>

<p>Clobery laughed insultingly.</p>

<p>"How much, pray, have you to offer? A couple of gold pieces and a pair
of earrings? No, these papers go straight to King George's own hands;
he will pay for them fast enough."</p>

<p>With a sob Letty dropped on her knees, and Joan followed her example;
together they besought the spy for mercy.</p>

<p>He jeered at them, and, catching up the light, cried: "Farewell, my
pretty mistresses, I will e'en borrow this as far as the window, where
I made my entry. You have helped me much and I am beholden to you."</p>

<p>He left the room, waving the bundle of priceless documents derisively.
Joan and Letty rushed after him, not to be left in total darkness.
There was more light in the long corridor, and suddenly they caught
sight of a tall figure advancing towards them. It was clad in a long
brown cloak with a hood drawn over its head, and for a moment the
girls, in terror, fancied it might be a ghost. Then Letty gave a loud
cry: "Dick, Dick, get the papers from him!"</p>

<p><br></p>

<figure class="figcenter" id="image019" style="max-width: 25.8125em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/image019.jpg" alt="image019">
</figure>

<p><br></p>

<p>The spy dashed the light on the floor and took to his heels; but he
had someone after him who knew the house better than he did. Clobery
was armed, but so was Dick Saxilby, and when they met, just by the
open window by which the traitor had entered, it became a fight to
the death. The young Jacobite was a good swordsman, and presently his
weapon shot under the other's guard, and Clobery fell with a shriek to
the ground.</p>

<p>"You have beaten me," he muttered, and rolled over and died.</p>

<p>There was so little light that young Saxilby could not tell who was his
fallen enemy, but the two girls quickly put him in possession of the
facts of the case.</p>

<p>"He deserved what he got," was Dick's comment; "and now we must get a
fresh light from old Doggory and burn the papers. Faith, I could have
managed the business before, but I knew not where they were hidden."</p>

<p>When the deed was accomplished, Joan and Letty heaved a sigh of great
relief. What a case of touch-and-go it had been! If Dick had not been
in hiding in his own home, which boasted of as many as three secret
chambers, and so was as safe a place as any, the papers would assuredly
have been carried off.</p>

<p>As it happened, the accusation against Lord Saxilby and his fellow
prisoners fell to the ground for want of evidence, and after some
months they were released. It was a happy family party that met then at
Iver; but Joan and Letty never forgot that night when their father's
life hung upon a single thread.</p>

<p>"HAS the boy eaten his fill?"</p>

<p>"Ay, enough for six, the young villain."</p>

<p>"Then pass him along here, Patch," and Captain Firebrace turned to
look once more across the tranquil ocean at a half-dismantled vessel,
which his own was slowly leaving behind it. The sky was so blue, the
air so warm, and the sea so calm that it was difficult to believe that
only a couple of days before they had been tossed about by a furious
hurricane. Yet so it was, and although the "Morning Star" had weathered
the storm, it appeared that other vessels had not been equally
fortunate.</p>

<p>"A sail on the weather-bow," had shouted the man at the mast-head, a
warning which put Captain and crew instantly on the alert, looking to
the priming of the guns. It was for no good and peaceful ends that the
rakish-looking "Morning Star" sailed the high seas, as more than a
dozen unlucky merchantmen had found to their cost.</p>

<p>On this occasion there was no resistance, for the schooner espied by
the watcher was drifting about helplessly, and when Firebrace and his
men boarded her, the only living soul they found was a boy locked
in a cabin, and half dead of hunger. It was clear that the crew and
passengers, expecting the ship to go down, had taken to the boats.</p>

<p>Roger Cary, fortified by a good meal, was able to stand up and reply
to the Captain's questions. The ship, he declared, was the "Speedy
Return," bound for Jamaica; his uncle, Austin Cary, being the Captain.
He himself hailed from Devonshire,—Roger, only son of Squire Cary of
Paignton, and he had run away from home, being wild to go a sea trip.
He could not say who had locked him into the cabin.</p>

<p>"H'm," remarked Captain Firebrace drily, "failing you, I presume this
uncle of yours is your father's heir, is he not? Well, you would have
starved like a rat in a trap had we not chanced upon your ship. And
now, my young cock-o'-the-west, the point is, what are we going to do
with you."</p>

<p>"I will gladly work," began Roger eagerly, but he was interrupted
by a hoarse voice, and the huge giant, Patch, thrust forward his
grim-looking visage.</p>

<p>"Cap'n," he cried, "'tis our opinion, me and my mates, that the boy
should go overboard to the sharks without more ado. We want no spies
and mealy-mouths here: our necks be none too safe for that."</p>

<p>Roger turned a shade paler, and fixed his eyes imploringly on the
Captain's handsome, reckless face.</p>

<p>"Ay, Cap'n, let him walk the plank," roared Long Andrew, the bo'sun.</p>

<p><br></p>

  <img class="w100" src="images/image021.jpg" alt="image021">
</figure>

<p><br></p>

<p>Captain Firebrace drew a pistol from his belt and played with it
carelessly.</p>

<p>"I'd have you know, Patch and the rest, that I am master here, and
if any man disputes it, let him step forward." He paused, but no one
accepted the invitation. "Well, then, this lad is going to stop here
as ship's boy, and he'll earn his victuals that way, or the rope's end
will teach him how. As for being a spy, if we are taken, he will swing
the same as we shall, take my word for it."</p>

<p>Roger breathed more freely, for he understood that the Captain was
on his side. But he was a shrewd lad and he felt certain that he had
fallen in with what was politely termed a gentleman adventurer and his
company, otherwise a band of pirates, and he wondered greatly whether
he would ever see his home again.</p>

<p>A life of hardships, such as he had never dreamed of, now began for
the squire's heir. Instead of being waited on, he was at the beck and
call of every one, kicked and cuffed by the sailors, badly fed and
overworked. His clothes were soon in rags, and his face and hands
tanned a deep brown. His worst enemy was Patch who seemed to bear him a
special grudge.</p>

<p>The "Morning Star" had a treacherous trick of flying whatever colours
seemed best at the time, and it was under cover of the French flag that
it seized a merchant ship sailing from Rouen, and plundered it. The
French captain and all the sailors were made to "walk the plank," and
Patch, dragging Roger maliciously to the side made him watch them leap,
one after another, into the swirling waters below. They died like brave
men, shouting. "Vive la France!" but Roger, after that sight, had no
mind any more for the joys of a pirate's life, of which he had so often
dreamed at home.</p>

<p><br></p>

<figure class="figcenter" id="image022" style="max-width: 30.8125em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/image022.jpg" alt="image022">
</figure>

<p><br></p>

<p>Time wore on, and still Roger found no way of escaping from his
bondage. The "Morning Star" only put into port at out-of-the-way
places, and even then, a strict guard was kept and he had no chance of
getting away. And how could he hope that their vessel might be seized
by some other, since, if taken, he would certainly be hanged with the
rest, as the Captain declared?</p>

<p>Captain Firebrace seemed made of different stuff to Patch, Long Andrew,
and the others. He was, in fact, a gentleman adventurer, and dominated
his lawless crew by virtue of a stern will and reckless courage. Openly
he showed the "ship's boy" no favour, Roger felt nevertheless that the
Captain was his friend. Once, when nearly all the men were sleeping
after a carousal, he called the boy into his cabin, and plied him with
questions about his home and the folks of Paignton.</p>

<p>A year passed, and his own mother would hardly have recognised Roger in
the ragged, sunburnt lad who swabbed the decks and helped the cook. One
small ray of hope lingered in his mind: the Captain had once whispered
in his ear. "Keep up a good heart, lad: thou'lt see Paignton yet." But
the time seemed far off, for now the "Morning Star" was cruising in
Spanish waters, having had news of a galleon laden with treasure. This
put the crew in high spirits, but their chief was plainly uneasy.</p>

<p>"There is a storm brewing," he cried, and presently Roger heard him
roar out the order, "Furl all sails!"</p>

<p>"We shall get it hot and strong directly," said Long Andrew, as he went
aloft. A white sheet of foam enveloped the waves, the wind shrieked in
the rigging, and the men could not secure the flapping canvas to the
yards. A furious squall struck the ship; there came a loud crash, and
the top-mast snapped and fell with its spars into the sea.</p>

<p>Roger crawled up from below, and saw that Captain Firebrace was at the
helm. The waves rose to a terrific height, and it seemed to the boy
that every minute would see them engulfed.</p>

<p>They were not far from the shore, which bristled with dangerous rocks,
and in spite of the Captain's efforts, it was evident that the "Morning
Star" was drifting towards them. One of the crew, a Spaniard, Pedro by
name, was acquainted with the coast, and a look at his anxious face was
enough to show Roger that their danger was great.</p>

<p><br></p>

<figure class="figcenter" id="image023" style="max-width: 30.8125em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/image023.jpg" alt="image023">
</figure>

<p><br></p>

<p>They were so near the land now that they could see a white sandy beach,
with a high barrier-reef against which the waves were furiously dashing.</p>

<p>"See, there is a passage between those two rocks," yelled Pedro,
"yonder lies St. Diego, and if we can get through we may be saved."</p>

<p>The next minute the "Morning Star" was racing towards the rocks.
Roger could distinguish people standing on the shore. A sudden shock
was felt, the ship, striking on a rock, quivered, stopped short for
a brief instant, then heeled over, and was sucked into the depths
below. Roger was swept away on the crest of a huge wave; but he felt an
arm clutching him, and in the moment before he lost all knowledge of
things, saw the Captain's pale, dauntless face close to his own. They
were whirled on together by the torrent of heaving water, which closed
over their heads.</p>

<p>After long ages, so it seemed to the boy, he woke again, coming back to
life slowly. A Spanish woman was looking at him earnestly, and by her
side stood Long Andrew. When Roger was sufficiently recovered to hear
what had happened, he found that he and Andrew were the only ones who
had been saved. Some of the fishermen had rushed into the surf, and
dragged out himself and Captain Firebrace, who had been swept through
the opening between the rocks, fast locked together. But the pirate
Captain had been battered against the rock, and when they drew him out,
he was dead.</p>

<p>It would take too long to relate Roger's adventures before he reached
his home, which he eventually did. Long Andrew kept to himself the fact
that the wrecked ship was the redoubtable "Morning Star," and when
he took service again, it was in a more honest way. One thing Roger
learned from him, namely that Firebrace was an assumed name, not the
pirate captain's true one.</p>

<p>"He was Devonshire born, same as you and me," said Andrew, "and I
believe he hailed from Paignton. Otherwise, my lad, likely you'd ha'
been given a berth in Davy Jones's locker, 'stead of on the 'Morning
Star.'"</p>

<b>HOW A DRUMMER BOY SAVED A REGIMENT.</b><br>
<b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By G. A. Henty.</b><br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>"ARE you tired, Tommy?" a soldier asked a little drummer boy who was
seated on a rock watching a regiment that had just fallen out preparing
to bivouac. It was a newly-arrived corps, and had come up from the
coast by forced marches to join the army which, having won the battle
of Vittoria, was now engaged at various points among the Pyrenees with
the enemy, who were trying to bar their passage.</p>

<p>Tommy Pearson was the youngest member of the regiment, being but eleven
years old. His father had been the drum-major of the corps, and Tommy
was a general favourite, and at his father's death, three weeks before
the regiment left England, the colonel was asked by a deputation from
the men to allow Tommy to accompany them, promising that he should be
no trouble on the march. Young though he was, the boy could handle the
drumsticks as well as many of those years older than himself, and the
colonel, after some hesitation, granted the request, saying to the
major: "One can always find a place on one of the baggage-wagons for
him; his weight will make no difference one way or the other to the
team; he is a bright little chap, and we may consider him a legacy to
the regiment from his father, whom we all liked and respected."</p>

<p>So Tommy, to his great elation, was permitted to go. For the last three
years he had, although not on the strength of the regiment, marched in
uniform like the other drummers, and many an exclamation of amusement
or admiration had been uttered as the little chap walked stiff and
upright in the front rank.</p>

<p>The promise the men had given had been carried out on the long march
from the sea-coast. Tommy had each morning for some miles marched
with the band, and when he had to give up, which he never did until
absolutely unable to go farther, he was hoisted on to the top of a
baggage-wagon, or, if these happened to be far in the rear, his drum
would be taken by one of the buglers, and the boy himself would be
carried by the soldiers in turn. During the latter part of the journey
he had seldom been obliged to give in, but had manfully struggled on
till the regiment reached the end.</p>

<p>"I am a bit tired," he said; "but that doesn't matter. It has been a
long march and very much up hill, but it has been cooler than it was,
and I could go a mile or two farther, though I don't say I wasn't glad
to stop."</p>

<p>The regiment, which now formed part of a column consisting of a brigade
of infantry, cavalry regiments, and a battery of artillery, had
bivouacked on a plateau a quarter of a mile from the road, which here
passed through a defile.</p>

<p>As soon as the men had fallen out, they scattered in search of dried
bushes that would afford firewood. The baggage-wagons had not come
up, and it would be an hour or two before the bullocks which followed
them would arrive; but the men had the day before had three days'
rations of cooked meat and bread served out to them, and were therefore
independent of the train. Tommy, after a rest of half an hour; joined
the other drummer boys, and, after eating his ration, wandered about
among the soldiers, most of whom had some cheery remark to make to him.</p>

<p>"I expect, Tommy," one said, "it won't be long before we catch sight of
the French, and then we shall have bullets whistling about our ears.
You will have a better chance than the rest of us, seeing that you
offer such a small mark."</p>

<p>"Tommy will be safe enough," said another; "I expect he will be told
off to wait for the baggage and to help to give the wounded water."</p>

<p>"I shall be where the others are," the boy said sturdily; "now that I
can do a day's march all right, I can go into a fight with the other
fellows."</p>

<p>"The other fellows won't go into the fight, Tommy; in the first place
they would be in the way, and in the second place all who are big
enough will be stretcher-carriers; those who are too small for that
will be stowed somewhere out of harm's way. What would you do if a
French grenadier came at you?"</p>

<p>"I don't suppose I could do much," the boy said; "but if he was a brave
man, he would not try to hit me."</p>

<p>"Right you are, Tommy: no soldier would care to massacre an innocent:
it is only a chance shot you need be afraid of. There is one thing: if
by accident you did get near the enemy, you would only have to stand
behind a good-sized man to be perfectly safe."</p>

<p>The boy laughed. "Well, we shall see, Jones. I don't know what a fight
is like yet or how I shall feel; but I don't suppose that I shall be
more frightened than anyone else."</p>

<p>After their long march and the prospect of another the next day, the
troops were glad to wrap themselves in their cloaks and lie down as
soon as darkness came on, especially as but little brushwood had been
found and the fires were already burning low. After the heat of the
plains they felt the cool mountain air, and grumbled that the baggage
with the tents had not come up. Tommy, although he had chosen a place
in the shelter of the rock, found the cold bitter, and as soon as it
was dawn got up and stamped his feet to set the blood in circulation.</p>

<p>"Very likely we may not have a long march to-day," he said; "and
anyhow, I would rather be tired than be as cold as I am at present." In
about half an hour the camp was beginning to stir.</p>

<p>"I will go for a little walk," he said; "they will be an hour or two
before they fall in. I may as well take my drum with me: then I shall
be ready when the bugle sounds."</p>

<p>It was broad daylight now, and, putting the strap of the drum behind
his shoulder, he started. Other soldiers were already moving about
outside the ground they occupied in search of firewood, and the
sentries paid no to him. The plateau extended for some little distance,
and then terminated at the foot of a sharp ascent of rocky ground.
The boy climbed up to a small ledge and then sat down to look around.
From the point where he seated himself he was only five or six hundred
yards from the camp, and, although he could not see it, he knew that he
should hear the first sound of the bugle. Looking down into the defile
he saw that it ran steeply up, and noticed that it forked a little in
advance of him, and that another road joined the one in the defile.</p>

<p><br></p>

<figure class="figcenter" id="image025" style="max-width: 25.8125em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/image025.jpg" alt="image025">
</figure>

<p><br></p>

<p>In a few minutes he saw a general officer closely followed by two light
dragoon officers and accompanied by a peasant ride along a plateau
similar to that occupied by the regiment, and facing him on the other
side of the defile. Some fifty yards in their rear were two mounted
orderlies. The general stopped when nearly opposite Tommy, and the
peasant was evidently explaining to him the nature of the road, the
difficulties to be met with, and the direction in which it bore after
crossing the crest of the hills. The boy instinctively slipped off
the ledge on which he was sitting and seated himself behind a rock,
and thence watched the proceedings of the party, who were some three
hundred yards from him. The wall of the defile was there very steep
indeed, almost perpendicular, and from the spot where the general
had halted, a few yards from its edge, he could not see the road
immediately beneath him.</p>

<p>Suddenly the boy saw a troop of cavalry emerge from the other road.
Thinking that the cavalry had sent out scouting parties, he paid but
little attention to them. Behind them came a battery of artillery,
with infantry marching in single file on either side of them. Suddenly
an idea occurred to him and he leapt to his feet. Surely these were
not English soldiers! they might be the Spaniards! He watched them
until the cavalry were nearly abreast of him; then, as a battalion
of infantry followed the guns, he saw a flag that he recognised:
it was the enemy. His own regiment had led the way, and the other
three regiments of the brigade were encamped some three miles away.
He started to run back; then an idea struck him and he seized his
drumsticks and beat the alarm. As he hurried along, glancing across the
ravine, he saw one of the officers with the general leap from his horse
and, going to the edge, look down into the ravine. Then the general
galloped forward until he came to the edge of the gorge through which
the French were marching. He and his companions dismounted and went
forward a few steps, evidently to obtain some idea of the strength of
the enemy.</p>

<p>Tommy could now see the camp: bugles were sounding the assembly, and
the men hastily ran in. The alarm had been given, and, slinging his
drum behind him, he ran forward. As he did so, he saw the colonel ride
out to the edge of the plateau, which was three hundred yards from the
spot where the troops were falling in. A single glance sufficed, and
he galloped back, shouting as he did so, and, without waiting for the
men to form up, led them back. Those who arrived first at the edge of
the descent had at once opened fire upon the troop of French cavalry;
the rest as they arrived were hastily formed up, and the two flank
companies dashed down the steep descent and flung themselves upon the
battery, while the rest, lining the whole edge of the ravine, opened a
murderous fire upon the French infantry.</p>

<p>These replied, but in some confusion, for they had no idea that the
British had already ascended the pass, and had anticipated taking up
a position near its mouth to prevent them doing so. The attack on the
guns was completely successful, and the cavalry, of whom many had been
killed from the first fire, had turned their horses and galloped back,
carrying the thin line of infantry before them and spreading confusion
among the artillery. These knowing that the infantry brigade would bar
their retreat and would speedily come up to their assistance, fought
stoutly, but were unable to withstand the impetuous assault of the
British infantry. The struggling horses and the guns completely blocked
the ravine, and the infantry, falling fast under the fire from above,
were unable to make their way through them. They were wholly unaware of
the strength of their enemy, and, although their officers succeeded in
restoring something like order and leading parties up the steep ascent,
they were unable to withstand the fire to which they were exposed, and
in a short time the trumpets sounded the retreat. Just as they did so,
the general, who had ridden back to point where he could gain the road
and ascend the other side, rode up.</p>

<p><br></p>

</figure>

<p><br></p>

<p>"I congratulate you, colonel," he said; "you have given them a smart
check. As far as I can judge, there must be close on five thousand men,
and if they had taken that strong position lower down, where a bridge
crosses a torrent, we should have had hard work to dislodge them, and
should certainly have suffered heavily in doing so. They can have had
no idea that we had pushed up the pass; if they had persevered, they
would have put you off altogether. I was in ignorance that the side
road came in here: these Spanish maps are altogether untrustworthy,
and the guide that I have with me answered my questions about the road
ahead, but said nothing of the one coming down into it. It was well
indeed that you posted that drummer in advance, though of course a
sentry would have done as well. I see your men have taken all the guns
of that battery."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, it has been a very fortunate affair; but I certainly can
take no credit to myself for the drummer being up that hill. Of course
I had sentries round the camp and one placed so as to command a view of
the road ahead and to warn us of any troops coming down the crest; but
from its position he could not see down into the defile below. I knew
nothing of that side road, or of course I should have placed a sentry
to watch that also. During the night I had an outpost out on the road,
but they marched in at daylight and either did not observe the other
road or, at any rate, they made no report of its existence when they
came in. How the drummer came to be out there is a mystery to me, and
I was astonished at hearing the alarm beaten; there is no doubt that
it saved the regiment, for, as you say, had the enemy passed the spot
where we turned off to march up here we should have been completely cut
off, though they would not have captured us without a sharp fight, for
I should have known that the rest of the brigade would have come up to
our assistance as soon as they heard the sound of firing." He turned to
one of his officers: "Ask Sergeant Wilkins to come here."</p>

<p>The sergeant who was in charge of the drummers came up in two or three
minutes.</p>

<p>"Sergeant, did you send a drummer out this morning?"</p>

<p>"No, sir; I should not have thought of doing such a thing without an
order."</p>

<p>"Then who was it that beat the alarm?"</p>

<p>"That I cannot say, sir; they had not paraded this morning, so I do not
know who was missing and I was amazed when I heard the alarm. I thought
at first that it must be one of the lads who had taken his drum and had
gone out to practise, though I could hardly imagine how any one of them
could have ventured to do so and to risk causing an alarm."</p>

<p><br></p>

<figure class="figcenter" id="image027" style="max-width: 37.8125em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/image027.jpg" alt="image027">
</figure>

<p><br></p>

<p>"Weil, parade them here."</p>

<p>In a few minutes they paraded before the colonel.</p>

<p>"Which of you was it that gave the alarm?" the latter asked.</p>

<p>Tommy stepped forward and saluted. "Please, sir, I did."</p>

<p>The colonel and the general both smiled. "But how came you to be out
there?" the former asked.</p>

<p>"I was so cold, sir, that I could not sleep, so I got up and walked
about till the soldiers began to go out to look for firewood, and I
thought that I would go out too."</p>

<p>"But, in that case, why did you take your drum?"</p>

<p>"I took it, sir, so that if I heard the bugle sound I could run
straight back and take my place with the others. I was sitting down
when I saw the French come running into the road. I did not know that
they were French at first; I saw that they were not our men, but I
thought they might be Spaniards till I saw a French flag among the
infantry, and then I thought the quickest way was to beat the alarm."</p>

<p>"You did very well," the general said kindly; "if it hadn't been for
you a whole regiment would have been captured, to say nothing of
myself. Why, colonel, how is it that such a brat as this should be in
the regiment?"</p>

<p>The colonel gave him the reasons for which he had brought the boy.
"The men are all fond of him," he said, "and he has certainly kept
his promise that he should be no trouble. At first he could not keep
up with the marches, and was either perched on a baggage-wagon when
he could go no farther, or if the baggage was all in the rear of the
brigade they would take him on their backs; but for the last week he
has managed to keep up well."</p>

<p>"He must be a sharp little beggar," the general said; "it is not every
boy of his age that would have thought of beating the alarm, and every
minute was of importance. Well, lad, you have begun well," he said,
"and should turn out a smart soldier some day. Of course I shall report
the matter to Lord Wellington. He is a man who does not forget things,
and I have no doubt that if your colonel is able when you are old
enough to recommend you for a commission, what you have done to-day
will go a long way towards your obtaining it."</p>

<p>It may well be imagined that after this Tommy's popularity in the
regiment greatly increased, and there was much grief when he was
wounded at the battle of Toulouse. He recovered, however, and drummed
his hardest when the regiment advanced for a final attack upon the
Old Guard on the field of Waterloo. Six years later he obtained a
commission, and commanded the regiment in which he had once been a
drummer boy at the hard-fought battles of the campaign which terminated
with the conquest of the Punjaub in 1845-6.</p>

<p class="t1">
<em><b><a id="Story_7">Never Trust a Stream</a></b></em><br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>THE thunder had roared up in the hills where the old engine-houses
stood ruined and bare against the sky, and the lightning twice over
flickered out of the black clouds and seemed to play round the grey
granite stones, before down came the rain like a thick mist and blotted
everything out.</p>

<p>And all the time down in the lowland toward the sea it was a brilliant
summer's day—"perfect weather," Sydney Lee's father said, "for July."</p>

<p>Linny, Syd's sister, brightened up, for she had looked solemn and
disappointed. Syd was at home for the midsummer holidays, and brother
and sister were making the best of them. In fact, there was a project
on that day, planned by Syd. It had something to do with the little
punt lying in the stream which turned the waterwheel which in turning
worked the stamps used for crushing the tin ore brought up out of the
deep mine by the men working under Syd's father, who was the manager
to the mining company, and lived in one of the prettiest houses that a
Cornish valley could show.</p>

<p>But that project had something to do as well with little trout which
hid under the stones in the clear water, and under wildflowers on the
bank, and possibly with a late nest of a certain dipper which Syd had
seen flitting about, like a great black-and-white cock-tailed wren
gifted with the power of walking about and swimming under water to
catch beetles and other insects, and looking all the time as if its
black jacket was dotted with pearls, which rolled off and proved to be
air-bubbles, as soon as it came to land.</p>

<p>But there were endless things to see in the swift little stream that
ran by Huel Vro, and Linny saw them so much better when she had Syd
with her to pole the punt along, and catch jack, or wade for the
various treasures they found.</p>

<p>So they were off on the expedition when the storm came on, made a
tremendous fuss in the hills miles distant, and then began to die away.</p>

<p>"What a glum face!" cried the manager. "I believe there are tears ready
to come."</p>

<p>"No, no, Papa, I won't cry," said Linny; "but it is so disappointing,
and Syd's holidays are so short."</p>

<p>"All the sweeter while they last, Lin," said the manager. "There, cheer
up; the storm is passing along the hills. Be off with you. Not a drop
of rain will fall this side."</p>

<p>"Oh!" cried Linny joyously, and she made a spring at her father to
reward him for his good news, while he helped her by jumping her up
breast-high.</p>

<p>"Going to take the little punt, Syd?"</p>

<p>"Yes, father."</p>

<p>"Very well, but keep out of the dam."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, father; of course."</p>

<p>"That's right. Then you cannot get into mischief."</p>

<p>The young folks dashed off past where the waterwheel was going and the
stamps turning, while where the ore was being washed below the stream
ran red and thick, but upward beyond the house it was clear as crystal.</p>

<p>The punt, which was like a washing-tub grown out of knowledge, lay in
a shallow tied to a post, and Syd ran into the carpenter's shop, where
the man who did the repairs to the mine machines good-humouredly took
out his saw from the tool-basket, cut a short board in two, and gave
it to the boy for seats. These two were carried down to the punt and
placed across fore and aft, after Syd had waded in to draw the punt
ashore. Linny jumped in and took her place forward, Syd lifted the
short pole which lay in the bottom, and then began to thrust the boat
along through the shallow water, in and out among the pieces of granite
which half filled the bed of the stream, and, after getting aground at
least a dozen times, Syd managed to get up to the most beautiful part
of the tiny river, where the fishing and flower-gathering began.</p>

<p>Syd had the former all to himself, for, as he said, it was not girl's
work to wade about, sometimes knee-deep, and get your arms wet feeling
under ledges and among stones for tiny trout.</p>

<p>"You get your flowers," he said, and to help his sister he thrust the
boat head in here and there close under the rocky banks which ran
straight up and often hung over in the shady places where the most
beautiful flowers grew.</p>

<p>And so an hour of real delight passed away, with the clear water
sparkling in the sunshine here, and turning dark there, where the ferns
hung over the great stones which looked as if they had been built up
like walls by giant hands.</p>

<p>"Oh, I am glad the storm did not come our way," said Linny, standing up
to balance herself on her seat so as to reach up and pick at a cluster
of purple loosestrife. "Oh!" she cried, springing down to crouch
directly, for she nearly went overboard. Then, seeing her brother's
mocking face where he stood with the water just gliding by the knees of
his knickerbockers, "what a shame, Syd! you joggled the boat."</p>

<p><br></p>

<p><br></p>

<p>"I didn't," he said.</p>

<p>"You did, sir!"</p>

<p>"I didn't—only poked this end down a little."</p>

<p>"Well, it was a shame. You might have made me tumble in—splash."</p>

<p>"Never mind; I'd have spread you out on the hot stones there in the sun
to dry. There, hold tight; I'm going to push the punt up higher. There
isn't a trout here."</p>

<p>Linny gave her long yellow hair a shake, sending her straw hat into the
bottom of the boat and her curls hanging loose all over her shoulders,
as she took her place carefully so as to trim the boat, while Syd
stepped in, took the pole once more, and sent the punt upstream a
couple of hundred yards, before he laid down the little pole and began
to look round for a likely place for a trout, while his sister's eyes
wandered amongst the floral riches of the lofty fern-hung bank for the
choicest flowers.</p>

<p>"I say, Lin," said Syd: "what's that?"</p>

<p>"That?"</p>

<p>"Yes: that grumbling noise."</p>

<p>"Thunder dying away in the hills," said the girl. "Push the boat to the
other side. I want some of those orchids—out there in the sun."</p>

<p>But the boy did not speak; he sat down and began to look up toward the
hills.</p>

<p>"I don't see any clouds over there," he said thoughtfully, "and yet
that noise goes on. Here, Lin," he cried suddenly, and in an excited
tone, "I'm going to push the boat in here. You jump out and climb up
the bank."</p>

<p>"No," said the girl, "not yet. I want some of those orchids. Push the
boat over there first."</p>

<p>"You do as I tell you," cried the boy firmly, and his brown face began
to turn white. He stopped down to seize the pole, but he was too late,
and dropped upon the seat in the stern again.</p>

<p><br></p>

<figure class="figcenter" id="image030" style="max-width: 37.8125em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/image030.jpg" alt="image030">
</figure>

<p><br></p>

<p>For all at once with a roar and a rush, a wave of foam-crested water
swept round the curve above them, and in an instant it was upon them,
leaping into the boat, which was directly after a quarter filled, and
turning the limpid trickling stream into a furious rushing torrent,
which tossed the boat from side to side, nearly overturning it before
sending it downward at a furious pace.</p>

<p>"Oh, Syd!" shrieked the girl, "what is it?"</p>

<p>"Sit still, and hold tight," he shouted. "Water—come down from the
hills."</p>

<p>The boat steadied directly after, but glided down at a furious rate,
promising to be capsized against one or other of the huge stones which
lay in the stream, as the boy seized the pole and stood up to try and
fend off the boat from the rocks or from being overturned against some
projecting block at the side.</p>

<p>But it was impossible to keep standing, for in thrusting with the pole
it slipped into a chink between two blocks of granite, stuck, and the
next moment was snatched out of his hand. There was nothing for it but
to sit down again, and to do that which he shouted to his sister.</p>

<p>"Hold on," he cried, "tight!"</p>

<p>And then away they went, sometimes head first, sometimes stern, and
not only broadside but turning round and round as one end or the other
of the punt crashed against some rock with a blow that threatened to
shiver the boat to pieces.</p>

<p>"Oh," groaned the boy to himself, "if we had only had time to jump
out!" But this was to himself, for he fought hard and bravely not to do
or say anything likely to frighten the poor girl seated holding on with
both hands in the front of the punt.</p>

<p>But Syd thought a great deal.</p>

<p>"We shall be upset directly," he thought, "or broken to pieces on the
stones."</p>

<p>But just then as he was gliding down backwards at an increasing
speed, so much water had come down that it grew less furious as it
became deeper, and in a few minutes they passed with a rush through
the narrowed part where the sides had been built in by the miners and
masons so as to shape buttresses to bear the ends of the wooden bridge
which carried the mine road.</p>

<p>Under it they passed, being almost shot under towards some blocks of
granite, at which the girl glanced in horror, for the water foamed
among them; but they escaped Syd's notice, for he was going backwards.</p>

<p>"Can you see anyone down by the water-gates?" said Syd suddenly.</p>

<p>"No, no," cried the girl. "Oh, Syd, Syd, Syd, are we going to be
drowned?"</p>

<p>"No," he shouted back. "Don't be frightened. The boat will be upset
soon, and then I shall swim ashore with you and climb up the bank."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Syd," sobbed the poor child. "Do, please. It would be
dreadful for poor Papa if we were drowned."</p>

<p>"Poor Papa" was standing below, gazing upstream with starting eyes, for
the roar of the torrent had awakened him and those above ground to the
danger, and the men had followed the manager to the water's edge.</p>

<p>"I see 'em, sir!" shouted the carpenter.</p>

<p>"Yes, here they come," cried Mr. Lee. "Hands, my lads—hands!"</p>

<p>He caught at the carpenter's extended hand and leaped into the water,
while three more men joined hands to form a human chain, which swayed
and nearly gave way before the pressure of the water, as the manager
reached out more and more to try and catch at the rapidly descending
boat.</p>

<p>"I shall never do it," he groaned. "Oh, my poor children!" and in
imagination he saw them swept out to sea.</p>

<p>But as he thought, he made a snatch at the boat's side, the effect
of which was to throw both children into the bottom, where the water
washed to and fro, while the men lost their footing, but not the
desperate grip of their hands.</p>

<p>There was a terrible struggle in the broken water, but the party, boat
and all, were borne close in, and more help coming from the stamp-mill,
in another minute all were safe, though drenched and breathless, while
the torrent for the next hour literally raged between the little
river's stony banks, which it was washing clear of flower and fern and
bearing all out to sea.</p>

<p>"Our poor boat, Syd!" said Lin, a couple of hours later, when the water
was sinking back.</p>

<p>"Yes," said the boy, with a sigh. "She's swept right away."</p>

<p>He was quite right, but the next morning a fisherman brought her back,
while the little river was once more flowing soft and clear.</p>

<em><b><a id="Story_8">"Jean-Pierre"</a></b></em><br>
<em><b>THE STORY OF THE ST. BERNARD</b></em><br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>IT was their first winter in England, and the Buckland children were
staring out of the window at the snowflakes that tumbled over each
other in their hurry to reach the ground.</p>

<p>"They're like tiny white sails," cried Oswald.</p>

<p>"Or dream-fairies' wings," suggested Molly, who had been reading Grimm.</p>

<p>"Or feathers from the sofa cushion we tored this mornin'," said Bobs
practically, hugging his arms in a queer little way he had when
anything delighted him. Jim did not say anything, but his wistful grey
eyes looked sadly at this strange snow that had already covered the
lawn, and he shivered a little as if he felt the cold.</p>

<p>"The proper thing to do now is to make snowballs," remarked Oswald,
remembering a thrilling snow-fight he had read of when he was in India.</p>

<p>"Hooray!" the others shouted, and the rafters of the old house rang
with their footsteps as they clattered off downstairs.</p>

<p>All but Jim. Jim stayed behind because he knew that if he went he
might spoil their fun, for though he was nearly three years older than
Bobs, he couldn't run half as fast, and grew tired quickly. He was
thin and pale and very small—"two sizes too small for his age," his
aunt had told him when he arrived. Since then he had done his best to
oblige them and grow big, but even Aunt Margaret, who had the prettiest
dimples and talked more gently than her sisters, could not say he had
succeeded.</p>

<p><br></p>

<figure class="figcenter" id="image032" style="max-width: 37.8125em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/image032.jpg" alt="image032">
</figure>

<p><br></p>

<p>"Never mind, old fellow," she would whisper. "You'll make a start when
the spring comes, and catch up Bobs. You'll see."</p>

<p>"Spring was a long time coming," thought Jim, as he turned from the
window towards the fire. The Viking, a big St. Bernard who belonged to
Aunt Margaret, and was far too dignified to romp with even the nicest
children, made room for him on the hearthrug, and actually allowed him
to lean against his fine broad back. Jim stroked him admiringly as he
stretched his magnificent limbs in front of the fire, and wished that
he too could be "splendid and big and brave."</p>

<p>"All in good time," said the Viking soberly. "But you needn't wait to
be 'big' before you are 'brave and splendid' you know—Jean-Pierre was
that, though he was as small as you, and had a crooked back besides."</p>

<p>"Jean-Pierre?" Jim questioned eagerly. The Viking shook himself,
and turned his head so that his broad muzzle rested against Jim's
shoulders, close to his ear.</p>

<p>"I was born in Switzerland," he said, "high amongst the mountains,
where the snow falls for weeks at a time, and sometimes buries whole
families beneath it. The monks of St. Bernard had trained my father,
with many other dogs of the same kind, to rescue travellers who lost
their way in trying to cross the mountains, and, but for an accident,
that would have been my work too. My father loved the life, and I
should have been as proud as he to share its dangers."</p>

<p>"Won't you tell me about it?" Jim asked coaxingly. "I want to hear
about Jean-Pierre, and why you say he was so 'splendid.' Did he wear a
beautiful shining sword, like Uncle Mark does? And could he fight?"</p>

<p>"Jean-Pierre had never seen a sword," the Viking said, "and though he
could fight well, it wasn't with enemies that you could see, but with
Hunger, and Fear, and Cold. But if I am to tell you what I know about
him, I must begin at the beginning."</p>

<p>"Twelve years ago I was one of a littler of sprawling puppies. My
mother declared that we were the handsomest she had ever had, but my
father said that size had nothing do with pluck, and that it was only
pluck that counted."</p>

<p><br></p>

<figure class="figcenter" id="image033" style="max-width: 25.8125em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/image033.jpg" alt="image033">
</figure>

<p><br></p>

<p>"How we puppies longed to be grown up, so that we too might show that
we were brave, and how we loved to see our father and his companions
start off in search of some lost traveller. The monks would fasten
flasks of brandy round their necks, and rugs and blankets on their
backs, and wish them 'Godspeed' solemnly. 'Mon Brave' they used to
call our father, and we often heard them speaking to visitors of his
wonderful sense of smell, and how he would dig out lost people from the
deepest snowdrift."</p>

<p>"One afternoon we learnt that two children were missing. They had
no mother, and their father, who had gone to a neighbouring village
to lay in food for the winter, had been cut off from them by the
snow. The storm had come before it was expected, and for days he had
not been able to reach his cottage. When he did, he found it empty.
Pinned to the table was a letter from the boy, who had been left in
charge of Rose Marie, his little sister. 'The Fairy of the Mountains'
people called her, because she was so very fair, and the boy—it was
Jean-Pierre—loved her more even than his father."</p>

<p>"The letter had been written the night before, and said that he and
Marie had been without food for three days then, and when morning came
were going to try 'the lower pass' in hopes of reaching the Monastery.
'I shall take care of Rose Marie,' he added, 'and keep the cold from
her.'"</p>

<p>"That day the snow had fallen more heavily than ever and the monks
shook their heads as they looked at the sky. 'Do your best, Mon Brave,'
they said to our father, and sent him off in advance of the other dogs."</p>

<p>"It was almost the coldest night we had ever known, even in the
Monastery; we puppies snuggled ourselves together beneath the straw,
and shuddered as we listened to the stories our mother told us of dogs
and travellers who had been buried under masses of fallen snow."</p>

<p>"But in less than an hour we heard the deep baying of the dogs, which
meant, we knew, that the children had been found. Some of the monks
seized their lanterns—for it was very dark, and set out for the
perilous track, that was so narrow in places that they could only move
sideways, and but few inches at a time."</p>

<p><br></p>

<figure class="figcenter" id="image034" style="max-width: 25.8125em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/image034.jpg" alt="image034">
</figure>

<p><br></p>

<p>"After a while the deep baying we had heard came nearer, and presently
'Mon Brave' bounded over the snow and into the courtyard. Strapped to
his back was a tiny girl, 'The Fairy of the Mountains,' and when the
monks who had stayed behind unrolled the blankets from her, we saw that
over her woollen jacket she was wearing a boy's coat, and that boys'
socks covered her sodden shoes, while the flannel shirt wrapped round
her must have been Jean-Pierre's too. He had 'taken great care of her'
as he said he would, and kept her from the cold."</p>

<p>The Viking's voice died dreamily away. Jim wanted to ask him what had
happened to Jean-Pierre, and why the Viking had come to England. But
while he was deciding which question to ask first, Oswald and Molly and
Bobs came rushing in.</p>

<p>"It was splendid," they cried together, and Jim said "splendid" too.
But he was thinking of Jean-Pierre, and how he had taken care of Rose
Marie.</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>THE little child was quivering all over. Hidden behind the arras of the
stately room where her sad-faced mother sat talking with sympathising
friends, little Patricia was listening with eager ears to the earnest
talk of the elders. The child knew that her father was in prison—in the
big prison which they could almost see from the windows of the house
they had come to live in to be near him. A knight faithful to his King
in the dreadful war only just ended, he was lying in prison, and every
day they feared to hear that his life had been made forfeit. Every
night little Patricia's pillow was wetted by her tears; every night
and morning she added to her customary childish prayers a petition
for her dear father's liberation. But she knew he was in the hands of
stern political and Puritan foes, and that her mother's heart was very
sore and heavy, and that the friends who came and went, and sought to
comfort them, feared the worst themselves.</p>

<p>But now her eyes were shining with excitement. Her little heart was
beating high with a new hope and purpose. When the door had closed upon
the last of the visitors, the little one came out from her place of
concealment, and, approaching her mother, she said:</p>

<p>"Mother, sweet, give me the letter. I will get it to father."</p>

<p>The lady looked down with her sad eyes full of wonder.</p>

<p>"My child—what do you mean?"</p>

<p>"Mother, I heard them talking. They said so much had been done. They
said all arrangements had been made; and that if only father could
get a letter—could read it and know—he might escape easily out of his
prison. That is the letter I want."</p>

<p>"But, my sweetling, they will not let you go to your father. We have
asked too oft—and have failed."</p>

<p>"I know, mother; I shall not be able to give it him myself. But little
Giles will give it for me!"</p>

<p>"My child—what mean you—are you dreaming? Who is Giles?"</p>

<p>"Why, mother—you must see him often on the green. He is the jailer's
little boy. He walks after us often. I give him my hand to kiss
sometimes. But only when there is nobody to see. He took a kiss from
me to father once; and gave me that from father too. I did not show it
you before. I thought it would but make you weep afresh," and the child
held up a little bit of wood, fashioned somewhat into the likeness of a
horse; the sort of thing that prisoners while away the time in seeking
to whittle with any little bit of metal which they may find about their
dress or in their cell.</p>

<p>The lady's tears fell fast as she pressed the little image to her lips,
and closely questioned the child about the boy, of whom she spoke with
such confidence.</p>

<p>Little Giles lived within the precincts of a prison, but he was a
bright-faced, brave-hearted little lad, whose merry voice had not
learned the nasal drawl of his father's friends, and who could not
make shift to subdue his natural gaiety of disposition in the way it
was desired of him. Perhaps his mother secretly encouraged him to
be blithe; perhaps he watched the cavalier gentlemen with too much
satisfaction and admiration to be a very staunch Puritan himself. And
of late, since that little cavalier maiden with the big brown eyes, the
rosy lips and the golden cloud of hair had come into the place, he had
thought and dreamed of little else than of being her faithful follower
and esquire all the days of his life.</p>

<p>He knew that her father was one of his father's prisoners; and he
sought every opportunity of making an errand into that part of the
prison where the cavalier knight lay, and of trying to see him whenever
it was possible. Giles was a handy little lad, and very willing and
obliging; so that he was sometimes sent on errands by his father or
his underlings, and not infrequently took the prisoners their food;
but some other and older person invariably accompanied him to lock and
unlock the doors, though he assisted by taking in the rations.</p>

<p>Just now and again the turnkey would pass on to another room for a
minute or so, leaving Giles in the one before; and thus he was able
very occasionally to comfort the heart of some captive by a whispered
hint as to what was going on without, or by a message from some loved
one hungering after news. No one suspected how the little fellow longed
to help and comfort the prisoners, or how his kind heart was moved by
any sight of suffering and sorrow.</p>

<p>But his little lady filled his thought now almost to the exclusion of
all else. He knew that she came daily to the green which lay betwixt
the fortress and the town, and he was ever on the watch for her,
counting it a red-letter day in his calendar when she should bestow a
smile upon him—still more when she should pause to speak a word to him.</p>

<p>She was never alone. Some servant was always in attendance. But upon
this bright June morning she came out with only a lad following her,
and in her hand she held a small bow and some arrows.</p>

<p>She did not seem to notice Giles, and shot her shafts here and there,
the boy running to pick them up. Giles would have loved to fill this
office himself; but the little lady gave him no encouragement, and he
stood shy and silent a little behind her.</p>

<p>Suddenly she shot an arrow more strongly than its fellows, and it
fell behind a low wall which guarded a small garden belonging to the
chaplain of the prison.</p>

<p>"Go, boy," she said, "you can climb the wall and find the arrow."</p>

<p><br></p>

<figure class="figcenter" id="image037" style="max-width: 25.8125em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/image037.jpg" alt="image037">
</figure>

<p><br></p>

<p>He ran to do her bidding, and was quickly lost to sight behind the
wall. There was nobody on all the green but the two children. The
little maid turned upon Giles and beckoned him to her side. With an
eagerly flushed face he came, quivering all over.</p>

<p>"Giles," she said very solemnly, "do you love me?"</p>

<p>"With all my heart and soul!" he answered with breathless fervour.</p>

<p>"Would you like to do something for me?"</p>

<p>"I would love it, little lady."</p>

<p>"But suppose they killed you dead for it?"</p>

<p>"Let them!" cried Giles, "I would not care one whit!"</p>

<p>"Giles," she said, slipping a letter into his hand which he instantly
hid in his doublet, "if you can give this letter to my dear father in
the prison, they say he will be able to get out, and his head won't be
cut off. But if anybody else finds it, they will kill him, and you too.
Boy, do you dare do it?"</p>

<p>"Of course I dare. I would die for you, little lady, or for anybody you
loved. I will give him the letter. If they kill me for it afterwards, I
shall not mind."</p>

<p>Patricia's little face suddenly quivered all over.</p>

<p>"Boy," she said, "O dear, dear good Giles, I don't want you to be
killed—I don't indeed. I love you next best to my father and mother—and
the King!"</p>

<p>And she suddenly threw down her bow and clasped her little arms about
Giles's neck, and pressed a kiss upon his lips.</p>

<p>Giles walked on air as he went homeward that day. Whatever else betided
him his little lady had kissed him: she had given him a share of the
love of her little childish heart.</p>

<p>       *       *       *       *       *</p>

<p>Long years afterwards, when King Charles the Second had been brought
triumphantly back to his kingdom, and exiled cavaliers were flocking
joyfully to these shores, a beautiful lady, traveling with her husband
and parents, stopped their coach at a certain town where a grim
fortress dominated the dwellings of the inhabitants, and asked if one
Giles Dorman lived within its walls.</p>

<p><br></p>

<figure class="figcenter" id="image038" style="max-width: 25.8125em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/image038.jpg" alt="image038">
</figure>

<p><br></p>

<p>Before long a fine and stalwart man appeared, at sight of whom the
young and lovely lady leaped lightly from the coach, and with a little
cry of recognition stepped forward with outstretched hands.</p>

<p>"Giles!" she exclaimed, "do you remember me?"</p>

<p>The man's bronzed face flushed from brow to chin. He slightly bent the
knee as those soft white hands met his own, and he bowed over them and
touched them with his lips.</p>

<p>A fine-looking gray-haired man now stepped up, and laid a hand on
Giles's shoulder.</p>

<p>"I must speak the words of thanks my daughter is scarce able to do,
and tell you that our errand to-day is to ask whether you will accept
the post of steward upon her estate; as she says she knows she will
never find anyone to serve her so faithfully and so well as Giles,
the jailer's son, of whom she has never ceased to talk in terms of
gratitude and praise."</p>

<p>She looked at him with eager eyes. Times had not been very kind to
Giles. He had grown up under a cloud of suspicion since the escape of a
certain prisoner. His face lighted as though a sunbeam had touched it.
The clouds were all rolling away.</p>

<p>"You will come then, Giles?" spoke the lady with kindling eyes.</p>

<p>"I will come with you to the world's end—and be your faithful servant
ever. I ask nothing better," said he.</p>

<p>"YOU'RE not afraid?" said father, turning at the door of the hut to
give me an anxious backward glance.</p>

<p>"Now, Dad, what should I be afraid of?" I answered, "there's no one
near to hurt me, except Deerfoot, and you don't suppose he would harm
me?" and I laughed right merrily, for I had known Deerfoot ever since I
had been a tiny little girl, and father and mother and George and I had
come to live out in the forest.</p>

<p>Now father and I were the only two left, for mother was dead and George
had left home the previous day on his way to New York City, where he
was to be given a place in our uncle's office.</p>

<p>Father was a little disappointed in George I think, and no one knew
how dreadfully I missed my quiet, studious brother. He was slight and
delicate and looked little like a farmer's son; but I knew that he had
a heart of gold, although he could not bear a farmer's life, and father
sometimes laughed at him for a molly-coddle.</p>

<p>On this particular day father had to go a long way off into the forest
to superintend the felling of a number of trees, which would afterwards
be floated down the river to the city.</p>

<p>"I shall hurry back," he said; "so have the kettle boiling about five
o'clock, and take care of yourself, little one."</p>

<p>I had a great deal to do and the morning passed quickly enough, so that
I never even guessed it was past dinner time until my healthy appetite
warned me. Then I sat down and made a hearty meal, and was just about
to clear away the dishes when something happened which startled me very
much.</p>

<p>There was a sudden "whir" and a blood-stained arrow came flying through
the open door and quivered in the wall behind me.</p>

<p>At first I tried to persuade myself that Dad had come home early and
had done it by way of a joke; but the sight of the arrow tipped with
a white feather dyed with an unmistakable red, made me turn pale and
shudder. Father would never play me a joke like that. I went out to
call Deerfoot; but he was nowhere to be seen, and then it occurred to
me that I had not seen him all the morning.</p>

<p>What could it mean? I walked about the outbuildings, calling to
him, but I was afraid of the sound of my own voice. I opened the
stable door, and Hector whinnied with pleasure, and shook his bridle
invitingly. But why was Hector bridled, and saddled? Suddenly it
occurred to me that some danger really menaced, and this was Deerfoot's
warning. In a flash I remembered the tales I had heard as a child of
Indian risings, and I remembered father's troubled face that morning.
I had laughed at fear then; but now it held me in its grip. I dare not
stay in the quiet house, and I led Hector out into the open, sprang
upon his back and was off like lightning for the clearing, where I
hoped to find father.</p>

<b>ON AND ON WE RACED</b><br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>I was only just in time, for I had scarcely got right away when I
heard a yell, and, turning in the saddle, I saw a party of howling and
maddened Indians riding towards our home.</p>

<p>I waited to see no more, but rode on and on for dear life towards the
clearing. I had not gone far when I met father.</p>

<p>"Why, dearie, what's wrong?" he cried. "I was cowing home early, for
those red rascals never turned up to-day, and so I only marked the
trees I wanted felled."</p>

<p>"Oh, Dad," I gasped, "there's a rising—I know there is—and they're
going to murder us!"</p>

<p>I told him briefly all that had happened, and without waiting for
comment, father mounted Hector, whilst I clung on behind him, and the
good beast was urged to its utmost speed.</p>

<p>A smell of burning and a glare in the sky told us that our home was
in flames, and by and by a distant yell of triumph warned us that the
Redskins were on our track.</p>

<p>Father said not a word, but by the beating of his heart I knew he
had heard. On and on we raced, but the horrid yells, came nearer and
nearer—the Indians were gaining on us. Now they were close behind; an
arrow whizzed past us, and I closed my eyes, hoping death would come
swiftly.</p>

<p>But now an answering yell arose, this time a shout of wild
encouragement, and it came from a white man's throat I knew. I still
kept my eyes tightly closed and clung to father's belt; but suddenly
I felt Hector being wheeled round, I was swung to the ground, and
opening my eyes, I saw I was in my brother's arms. He placed me behind
a mound, and from there I watched the fierce and terrible fight which
took place, and saw our foes completely routed and put to flight by the
little band of white men whom George had brought to our rescue.</p>

<p>When it was all over, George told us that at one of his resting places
news had been brought of the murder of a family of white people by
the Indians, and, fearing for our safety in our lonely home, he had
persuaded a party of men to return with him to bring us away until the
rising, if rising it proved to be, had subsided.</p>

<p>Well, they had only been just in time, and indeed, if it had not been
for Deerfoot's friendly warning to me, both father and I must have
perished.</p>

<p>The poor old fellow had been loyal enough towards us, and had tried
hard to persuade the chief to spare both us and our home but when he
saw that if he persisted in his entreaties he would be suspected of
being a traitor to his own people and would probably lose his life at
their hands, without benefiting us, he determined to warn us of the
danger which threatened us.</p>

<p>As his friends suspected him of some such intention he was watched, and
could not, therefore, approach the house closely, though he had managed
to let fly the blood-stained arrow, hoping we should read its message
aright.</p>

<p>I am glad to say he came to no harm during those troublous times; but
lived to serve us faithfully for many a long year.</p>

<p>As for father and George, they were brought very near together in that
terrible fight; for father learnt what a brave fellow he had for a son,
even though he would not be a farmer.</p>

<p>CAPTAIN AYRES sat in his hot little tent, writing. Outside there was
the breathless stillness of a June night in Burmah, and the heavy,
soaking, ceaseless rain had given him a touch of fever. For weeks he
had been leading his little force from point to point on the track of
the dacoits, or robber bands, and he was thoroughly disheartened, for
they had never yet had the least chance of a fight.</p>

<p>He was a police officer, and a very brave one, and was particularly
anxious to capture one of the head-men of the dacoits, just to make
certain that it could be done.</p>

<p>He wrote a little bit, and then stopped, and then wrote again. Outside,
the bright camp-fire crackled and sputtered, as the natives squatted
round it, and threw on the logs and damp leaves. Nearer still, quite
close to the entrance of his tent, he could see, between him and the
fire, a curly black head, laid upon a pair of folded arms. Really,
there seemed nothing to say—nothing, at least, that would interest his
mother, who knew very little indeed about dacoits, and would probably
hardly understand what he meant if he wrote about them.</p>

<p>He stretched out his legs, and yawned, and his sword, which was leaning
against the table, fell to the ground with a clatter. As it did so, the
little brown imp in the doorway rose hastily and almost fell into the
tent.</p>

<p>"Master."</p>

<p>Captain Ayres looked round impatiently.</p>

<p>"Boots! you here? You ought to have been asleep hours ago; go away at
once."</p>

<p>The little brown face grinned delightedly.</p>

<p>"Me stay by master," he said. "All chaps go to bed. Mangwee keep watch
with master."</p>

<p>"No, you don't," said Captain Ayres decidedly. "Mangwee go to bed with
all chaps, or he get bamboo stick in the morning."</p>

<p>The little brown face clouded over.</p>

<p>"Master, the dacoits all round. Master keep me, I keep master."</p>

<p>He spoke very earnestly, and pointed vaguely beyond the tent, but
Captain Ayres laughed.</p>

<p>"I wish the dacoits would come, old chap," he said; "but there's no
fear. Off with you!"</p>

<p>The boy tumbled out of the tent again; and pulled down the curtain as
he went, but Captain Ayres had plenty to tell his mother now. His pen
flew over the paper.</p>

<p>"In one of our raids on a village last week, I found the prettiest
brown boy in the world. His people are dacoits, and he thinks his
father has been killed. He knows a funny sort of broken English, and he
has devoted himself to me. He was nearly starving when we found him,
and I had to carry him eighteen miles into camp. He never leaves me,
and I have just had to chivy him off to sleep. He hates bed just as
much as Polly and Margey do, but he goes much more obediently. It is
such dull work! I wish these dacoits would come, and give us . . ."</p>

<p><br><br></p>

<p>He stopped abruptly, for a brown hand crept inside the curtain, and an
anxious round face peered after it.</p>

<p>Captain Ayres seized his revolver, and started to his feet, but he
dropped it again with an angry laugh.</p>

<p>"Boots, get out of this!"</p>

<p>"Master—dacoits."</p>

<p>"Nonsense!" said Captain Ayres. "Don't you know, boy, that the camp is
guarded, and there are outposts all round? If you don't do as I tell
you at once, I shall make a prisoner of you."</p>

<p>He looked sternly at the eager face, out of which the eyes shone like
stars. He saw a dull look of disappointment fall like a veil over his
features, and then the brown shadow seemed to fade into the darker
shadow of the tent. Boots had gone.</p>

<b>WRITING HOME</b><br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>Gone for the night, it seemed; but the look in his face haunted the
Captain. He picked up his revolver and loaded it, and then he drew
his sword nearer, and carefully removed a spot of rust, for when once
the rains come in Burmah it is almost impossible to keep steel in
perfect order. He felt wide awake, and alert. His neat report—reporting
nothing—lay folded on the table; the half-written letter to his
mother lay staring at him reproachfully; the deathly silence outside
was appalling. He pushed his chair back, lit his pipe, and loosened
his sword-belt. He wished some of his comrades had come in, as they
intended. He had an old pack of cards in his knapsack, and they might
have managed to play dummy whist—anything would have been better than
this idle loafing from place to place, with nothing to do.</p>

<p>His watch ticked loudly from the place on the tent pole where it hung.
He leant forward and looked at it. A quarter to two—and at that moment
a clear sharp cry divided the night, and sent the blood thrilling to
his heart—a cry three times repeated, "Master! master! master!"</p>

<p>With his sword on, and his revolver in his hand, he had flung up the
mat that formed the doorway in the hut before the echo died away. A
dark compact body of police were forming into a square, the sentries
and outposts were challenging, a quick rain of shot was pattering
on the leaves, and the little camp was alive with the steady tramp
of armed men. It was a most successful little fight, and Captain
Ayres won the first of his many medals on that night. He took the
head-man prisoner single-handed, and many of the dacoits were killed,
while many more were conducted by the courageous little force into
Mandalay, and were delivered up to justice. But when it was all over,
and the day had broken, showing the gloomy details of the fight,
Captain Ayres, pale and dishevelled, with his broken wrist tied up
in a pocket-handkerchief, wandered over the ground, disconsolate and
wretched, looking always for something he could not find.</p>

<p>It was Boots, of course; but no one could find Boots, not though the
Captain offered fifty pounds out of his own pocket for the discovery.
The small company of English soldiers, with two officers, and a doctor,
arrived in the early morning, but Ayres was intractable; he would not
sit still for a moment, or eat, or smoke, or behave in the least like a
reasonable being.</p>

<p>"I knew Boots' voice," he said huskily, "and I am sure the brutes
murdered him. He tried to warn me—he knew his own tribe, you see—but I
wouldn't believe him, and he saved the camp at the sacrifice of his own
life."</p>

<p>"Perhaps he went off with this tribe," someone suggested.</p>

<p>"I am sure he didn't," said Captain Ayres sharply. "However, we must
strike tents and go. Poor Boots!"</p>

<p>And would you like to know where Boots was all the time? He was hidden
close in the folds of Captain Ayres' own tent, where they found him
lying insensible, with a dark wound on his bare, brown breast. Not a
fatal wound, I hasten to tell you unless you should feel unhappy about
him; for Boots has grown up into a faithful servant, and has often
since then recklessly offered his life in defence of his master. He
wears a coat now, because he is a respectable member of society, and
also because his medal obliges him to do so.</p>

<p>Captain Ayres had plenty to add to that eventful letter to his mother,
but he had not time to do so for nearly a week afterwards. He wrote:—</p>

<p>"Boots has distinguished himself. The dacoits came in the dead of the
night, and sneaked past the sentries, and meant to rush the camp, but
Boots was one too many for them. They tried to silence him, but he
shouted to me, and roused the camp, before they put a spear into him.
He is doing well, and has been recommended for a medal, and so am I;
but the honour and glory are all to Boots!"</p>

<em><b><a id="Story_12">The Tale of Prince Tatters</a></b></em><br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>ONCE upon a time, a very long while ago, there was a little boy named
Tatters, or at least, folks called him so. Nobody knew his real name,
for, several years before, he had been left one winter day outside an
old woman's door. The old woman didn't like children. She was very
cross at first, but then she said, "He can work for me, if the worst
comes to the worst."</p>

<p>This old woman was really a witch: and every day she grew still uglier
and crosser, the more black magic she knew. Tatters did all the work,
and got nothing but beatings and blame. Whether he did things wrong or
right, she beat him just the same.</p>

<p>One day she went to gather various herbs and flowers, and she said, as
she locked in Tatters, "I shall be at least two hours. Chop the wood,
draw water, and clean the kitchen floor. And don't you touch the plants
in the pots—I've told you that before."</p>

<p>These plants were in the window; one had a yellowish bloom and the
other a pale pink blossom, with very sweet perfume. And when poor
Tatters had done his work he went and stood by their side. He thought
"they're the only nice things in the house," and when he thought that,
he cried, and his tears fell on the plants in pots, on the yellow one
and the pink and suddenly there was a crack and flash—and oh, what do
you think? There stood two little fairy men, in pink and yellow and
green, smiling very happily where the plants in the pots had been.</p>

<p>They said, "O, Tatters, you've set us free, and we'll help you now, if
we can. Don't be frightened, we're your friends. Our names are Spick
and Span. Do you know who you are, Tatters? You really were born a
Prince, but you were stolen away from home, nearly nine years since."</p>

<p>Just then there came a tap-tap-tap, the sound of the witch's crutch.
She saw the broken flower pots, and screamed "Have you dared to
touch?" but before she could say another word, Span blew on her—puff!
double-quick, and she found she couldn't speak or move. How she glared
at him and Spick! Then they took her crutch, which was really a magic
wand, and waved it, and said "Take us straight away to the Farthest
Back of Beyond!"</p>

<p>And a beautiful Golden coach drove up, that very minute: and Spick
and Span and Tatters immediately got in it. And they rode to Tatters'
palace; you can just suppose with what joy the king and queen, his
father and mother, welcomed their long lost boy! And Spick and Span
went home, to the side of a fairy hill.</p>

<p>But the old witch stayed as they left her: and no doubt she stays there
still.</p>

<em><b><a id="Story_13">Lost on the Fells</a></b></em><br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>IT was a soft Autumn day—and the dying grass looked yellow on the
fells. Beyond, and above them, the mountains rose in great wide sweeps,
with misty caps hiding the summits. Down in the village street a woman
was standing in the doorway of a small house with a little girl.</p>

<p>"Just take her a bit of a run, Harriet," she said to an elder child,
who was standing patiently in the roadway, "but don't tire her, like a
good little lass—nor yourself neither—you know your way over the low
fell, and you'll be back by tea-time. The washing'll be done by then,
and I won't say but what you'll find a cake in the oven."</p>

<p>Harriet took the child's hands, with an air of serious
responsibility—she might have been seventy instead of seven—her odd
little face, with the wide eyes and puckered forehead, belonged to
another race from her mother's round freckled comeliness—her large
mouth was always serious, but was sweet and calm.</p>

<p>"It's all right, Mother," she said; "you go right in and do the
washing, and Sally and me, we'll have a fine time on the fells."</p>

<p>They were half way down the street, when the mother called them back.</p>

<p>"You won't be late, loves—you know I'm a bit of a fidget!"</p>

<p>Harriet nodded vigorously—she was afraid her voice would not carry so
far. And so they turned the corner and were out of sight.</p>

<p><br></p>

<figure class="figcenter" id="image043" style="max-width: 37.8125em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/image043.jpg" alt="image043">
</figure>

<p><br></p>

<p>Sally skipped along up the gradual slope, shouting with glee, and
Harriet sauntered after her, bathed in the Autumn sunlight, pausing
every now and then to eat some blackberries, or to gather a spray of
crimson and yellow leaves, which looked like gold against the other
faded tints. On and on they went, until they were round the hill on
the narrow sheep-walk, with rough stones sticking up out of the grass
on either side—the sun had gone behind a cloud, and Harriet looked
up suddenly and saw that the soft white mist was creeping down the
mountain side, and blotting out every jutting peak and shining slope
as it came. It grew so dense about them presently that it felt like a
fine, soft rain, and a little wind blew it in the children's faces.
Harriet looked up and round her, and shivered. "Come, Sally," she
said, "it's very thick up the mountain—we'll run down the way we've
come—Mother's got a cake in the oven at home."</p>

<p>Sally came reluctantly, with her hands full of treasures—"Mayn't we go
round the other way," she said; "Mother said so."</p>

<p>Again Harriet looked up. The mist was closer now, pursuing them; out
of it patches of grey stone shone like gold, telling that the sun was
still behind the mist, but round their feet everything was white and
shapeless. They started running, but in a few minutes they had to go
more slowly, stumbling over crags and stones—leaving the path and
creeping back to it again by devious ways. Denser and denser grew the
mist, and very dark, but still they hurried on breathlessly.</p>

<p>"We must be nearly home now," said Harriet.</p>

<p>"Nearly home," echoed Sally, "I'se very tired."</p>

<p>Harriet paused abruptly, and knelt down.</p>

<p>"Get on my back, Sally," she said, "your poor little legs are not as
long as mine. We'll be home in no time."</p>

<p>She struggled to her feet again and crept slowly on, with the heavy
child clinging to her neck. Once or twice, a sort of wild fear took
possession of her, and she stopped and called, but her shrill little
voice did not carry far, and the thick fog isolated them. On and on
she struggled wearily, with the white mist on her hair and eyelashes,
panting and distressed, until at last she could go no further. She knew
that it was evening, because the mist was no longer white but heavy
grey, and when Sally rolled on to the ground, she lay where she had
fallen, half asleep, with her cold little legs tucked under her.</p>

<p><br></p>

<figure class="figcenter" id="image044" style="max-width: 37.8125em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/image044.jpg" alt="image044">

<p><br></p>

<p>"It's no use," said Harriet, "I've lost the way. It's hours and hours
since we began to walk, and there isn't a sound. We'll just have to
wait a bit till the fog lifts."</p>

<p>She took off her scanty petticoat and slipped it over Sally's legs,
and wrapped her tightly up—then she sat down on the path, with her
back against a stone, and took the whimpering child on to her knee,
holding her close, so that the damp wind should not strike her. By and
bye she sang a sort of crooning song, rocking the child in her tired
frozen arms, until she fell asleep, and lay quite still. Perhaps she
slept too—she was never quite certain, but suddenly it seemed quite
light, and there was a red harvest moon lighting up the heavens, and
myriads of stars sparkling on the mountain top like a crown. She was
sitting right on the path, just where they had been when the mist
came down—here was the blackberry bush—there the jutting rock—they
must have wandered all round the mountain and come back again to the
starting-point.</p>

<p>Harriet stretched her stiff limbs and staggered to her feet, but Sally
would not wake, so presently she gathered her up again, and went slowly
down the hill, sobbing and panting under her heavy burden, pausing
every few minutes to rest and breathe.</p>

<p>When she got down into the village street, it seemed alive with men.
The doors were all wide open, and there were lanterns everywhere. At
her Mother's door there was a silent group, with the minister in the
midst, and as Harriet pushed her way through they fell back and made
a passage to her Mother's side. She was sitting on the step, with her
face hidden, and her hair disordered.</p>

<p>"Mother," said Harriet, in a sobbing voice, "we're back safe."</p>

<p>The woman started to her feet, and took them both into her capacious
arms. She was trembling so much that she could not speak.</p>

<p>"She hasn't got cold, Mother," said Harriet eagerly, "feel her
feet—they are as warm as toast."</p>

<p><br></p>

<p><br></p>

<p>"Oh, my dear, my dear," said her Mother.</p>

<p>"And she hasn't got tired neither," went on Harriet quietly. "I've
carried her all the way."</p>

<p>"And you?" said the Minister. He had come to the front, and was beaming
on her through a pair of gold-rimmed spectacles.</p>

<p>"I? Oh, I?" said Harriet, staring—"I'm a big girl—there doesn't need no
one to mind me—Sally's a baby."</p>

<p>The minister looked from the rosy face cuddled to the woman's
bosom—back to the wide uplifted eyes that stared at him out of a thin,
cold face.</p>

<p>"Your mother is a happy woman, Harriet," he said. "To tell you the
truth, if I hadn't heard it from your own lips, I should hardly have
known which was the baby."</p>

<p>"Oh, sir," said Harriet, with a trembling voice.</p>

<p>"Only judging by the size, my dear," he said hastily. "Judging by the
spirit, and the heroism of it, there can be no doubt at all."</p>
